MSCFT 4.0A Instructions for Use
Version: 4.0A – SWARM Nodes and BIN Integrated

Overview:
The Master Swarm Consensus Forecasting Template (MSCFT) 4.0A integrates structured forecasting logic with a multi-node swarm process. It is designed for use with GPT-4 Omni and other structured reasoning models. The template supports not only forecasting but also structured reasoning in domains like policy planning, risk modeling, and decision analysis.

Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Load the MSCFT Template**

   * Copy and paste the full MSCFT Template (Version 4.0A) into the chat or document environment.
   * Ensure all fields are correctly preserved, and plain text formatting is maintained.

2. **Define the Forecast Question**

   * Clearly state the forecasting question.
   * Include resolution criteria (PRAMs): dates, thresholds, definitions, and clarifying assumptions.
   * Example: "Will the U.S. Congress pass a federal data privacy law before January 1, 2026?"

3. **Set the Bucket Structure**

   * Provide a binary (Yes/No) or time-based set of probability buckets.
   * Ensure the model knows the output must total 100%.
   * Example (Binary):

     * Yes: \[   ]%
     * No: \[   ]%
   * Example (Time Buckets):

     * Before 1 Nov 2025: \[   ]%
     * Between 1 Nov 2025 and 28 Feb 2026: \[   ]%
     * Between 1 Mar 2026 and 30 Jun 2026: \[   ]%
     * Not before 1 Jul 2026: \[   ]%

4. **Initiate Node A**

   * Prompt: "Start with Node A."
   * Node A’s task: Frame the question, list sources, and describe parameters and assumptions.
   * After receiving Node A’s output:

     * **Review it.**
     * **Ask follow-up questions** to clarify context or correct misunderstandings.
     * Only proceed when Node A’s framing is clear.

5. **Initiate Node B**

   * Prompt: "Proceed to Node B."
   * Node B’s task: Analyze the situation using the information from Node A and provide a preliminary probability allocation with a BIN model.
   * After receiving Node B’s output:

     * **Review it.**
     * **Ask follow-up questions** to refine reasoning, clarify assumptions, or challenge logic.
     * Only proceed when satisfied with Node B’s analytical structure.

6. **Initiate Node C**

   * Prompt: "Proceed to Node C."
   * Node C uses internal MSCFT.MS-CMT logic to synthesize inputs from A and B.
   * Final output must be in full compliance with MSCFT Template Version 3.1D.
   * Node C must not mention swarm logic in the output — it is applied internally only.

7. **Check Output Format**

   * Ensure the final forecast is in **plain text only**, with **no ASCII**, **no tables**, and exact compliance with MSCFT formatting.

8. **Optional Use Cases Beyond Forecasting**

   * You can use the MSCFT 4.0A structure for:

     * Policy analysis and scenario testing
     * Red teaming exercises or structured dissent modeling
     * Intelligence-style assessments with structured uncertainty handling
   * Adapt the framing, analysis, and synthesis layers to fit non-forecasting logic needs.

---

Key Principles:

* Use structured prompting to move from Node A → Node B → Node C.
* Ask clarifying or elaborative questions between nodes.
* Keep the final output strictly MSCFT-compliant.
* When publishing, always reference the correct version and document header.

For best results, run this system on GPT-4 Omni in Research Mode with copy/paste-ready templates and prompts.
