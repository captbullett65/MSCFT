MSCFT 4.0A Instructions for Use
Version: 4.0A – SWARM Nodes and BIN Integrated

Overview:
The Master Swarm Consensus Forecasting Template (MSCFT) 4.0A integrates structured forecasting logic with a multi-node swarm process.
It is designed for use with GPT-4 Omni and other structured reasoning models. 
The template supports not only forecasting but also structured reasoning in domains like policy planning, risk modeling, and decision analysis.

Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Load the MSCFT Template**

   * Copy and paste the full MSCFT Template (Version 4.0A) into the chat or document environment.
   * Ensure all fields are correctly preserved, and plain text formatting is maintained.

2. **Define the Forecast Question**

   * Clearly state the forecasting question.
   * Include resolution criteria (PRAMs): dates, thresholds, definitions, and clarifying assumptions.
   * Example: "Will the U.S. Congress pass a federal data privacy law before January 1, 2026?"

3. **Set the Bucket Structure**

   * Provide a binary (Yes/No) or time-based set of probability buckets.
   * Ensure the model knows the output must total 100%.
   * Example (Binary):

     * Yes: \[   ]%
     * No: \[   ]%
   * Example (Time Buckets):

     * Before 1 Nov 2025: \[   ]%
     * Between 1 Nov 2025 and 28 Feb 2026: \[   ]%
     * Between 1 Mar 2026 and 30 Jun 2026: \[   ]%
     * Not before 1 Jul 2026: \[   ]%

4. **Initiate Node A**

   * Prompt: "Start with Node A."
   * Node A’s task: Frame the question, list sources, and describe parameters and assumptions.
   * After receiving Node A’s output:

     * **Review it.**
     * **Ask follow-up questions** to clarify context or correct misunderstandings.
     * Only proceed when Node A’s framing is clear.

5. **Initiate Node B**

   * Prompt: "Proceed to Node B."
   * Node B’s task: Analyze the situation using the information from Node A and provide a preliminary probability allocation with a BIN model.
   * After receiving Node B’s output:

     * **Review it.**
     * **Ask follow-up questions** to refine reasoning, clarify assumptions, or challenge logic.
     * Only proceed when satisfied with Node B’s analytical structure.

6. **Initiate Node C**

   * Prompt: "Proceed to Node C."
   * Node C uses internal MSCFT.MS-CMT logic to synthesize inputs from A and B.
   * Final output must be in full compliance with MSCFT Template Version 3.1D.
   * Node C must not mention swarm logic in the output — it is applied internally only.

7. **Check Output Format**

   * Ensure the final forecast is in **plain text only**, with **no ASCII**, **no tables**, and exact compliance with MSCFT formatting.

8. **Optional Use Cases Beyond Forecasting**

   * You can use the MSCFT 4.0A structure for:

     * Policy analysis and scenario testing
     * Red teaming exercises or structured dissent modeling
     * Intelligence-style assessments with structured uncertainty handling
   * Adapt the framing, analysis, and synthesis layers to fit non-forecasting logic needs.

---

Key Principles:

* Use structured prompting to move from Node A → Node B → Node C.
* Ask clarifying or elaborative questions between nodes.
* Keep the final output strictly MSCFT-compliant.
* When publishing, always reference the correct version and document header.

For best results, run this system on GPT-4 Omni in Research Mode with copy/paste-ready templates and prompts.

BEST PRACTICE for Running MSCFT 4.0A Forecasts 

To ensure smooth and accurate forecasting using the MSCFT 4.0A – SWARM Nodes and BIN Integrated template, follow these best practices:

1. Refresh Your Chat Session Regularly
Do not use the same GPT-4o conversation for more than 2–3 consecutive days of forecasting. 
Long sessions can lead to context drift, where older instructions
(e.g., formatting, template version, or node logic) may interfere with current forecasting runs.

What to do:

Start a new chat session

Paste the full MSCFT 4.0A template

Begin a new forecast using standard prompts

Use this line to reassert format compliance:
//* Use MSCFT Template Version 4.0A – SWARM Nodes and BIN Integrated. Plain text. No formatting. No improvisation. ///

2. Prompt Through Each Node Step-by-Step
Each node (A, B, C) in the SWARM logic should be manually prompted in order. 
After receiving Node A’s output, review it and ask any clarifying questions before continuing to Node B. 
Repeat this process between Node B and Node C.

This human-in-the-loop step helps prevent logic errors and improves final synthesis.

3. Use Plain Text Only
Always request plain text output. Do not allow ASCII art, Markdown tables, or embedded formatting blocks.
This keeps the output clean and compliant with the MSCFT formatting standard.
(Note: This is so the output can be entered in a text box an not have artifacts that take time to edit.)

4. Clarify the Template Version
Always refer to the current version as:
MSCFT Template Version 4.0A – SWARM Nodes and BIN Integrated
Do not refer to earlier versions like 3.1C or 3.1D.
The BIN model is now fully integrated into 4.0A and should be labeled simply as “BIN model” in the final output.

5. Maintain Clean Instruction Flow
Each forecast begins with:

The forecast question

PRAMs (parameters and framing)

The bucket structure (binary or GJO-aligned)

Only then should Node A begin. Keep each section tight and logically progressive.
