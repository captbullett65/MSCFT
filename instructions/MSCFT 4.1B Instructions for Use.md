MSCFT 4.1B Instructions for Use
Version: 4.1B – SWARM Nodes and BIN Integrated (with Interpretation and Time-Series Nodes)

Overview:
The Master Swarm Consensus Forecasting Template (MSCFT) 4.1B expands structured forecasting logic using a five-node SWARM system. It is designed for use with GPT-4 Omni and other structured reasoning models.
This version includes formal integration of Nodes A–E and supports both forecasting and structured reasoning tasks in domains such as policy, risk, security, science, and multi-agent alignment.

Step-by-Step Instructions:

Load the MSCFT Template

Copy and paste the full MSCFT Template Version 4.1B into the chat or document environment.

Ensure plain text formatting is maintained.

Define the Forecast Question

Clearly state the forecasting question.

Include resolution criteria (PRAMs): dates, thresholds, assumptions, and source references.

Example: “Will a global AI safety agreement be signed before 1 January 2027?”

Set the Bucket Structure

Provide a binary (Yes/No) or time-based set of probability buckets.

All outputs must total 100%.

Example (Binary):

Yes: [ ]%

No: [ ]%

Example (Time Buckets):

Before Q1 2026: [ ]%

Q2–Q3 2026: [ ]%

Q4 2026: [ ]%

Not before 2027: [ ]%

Initiate Node A – Research Context

Prompt: “Start with Node A.”

Task: Frame the question, list sources, set key parameters, priors, and context.

Review the output, ask clarifying questions, and verify accuracy before continuing.

Initiate Node B – Analytical Filtering

Prompt: “Proceed to Node B.”

Task: Analyze Node A using the BIN model (Bias, Information, Noise). Provide preliminary probabilities.

Review logic, ask questions, and confirm analytical soundness.

Initiate Node D – Interpretation Layer

Prompt: “Proceed to Node D.”

Task: Choose either:

Markov chain modeling (for generalization/inference structure)

Entropy modeling (for probabilistic uncertainty)

Node D supports interpretation, not final synthesis. Only use when applicable.

Initiate Node E – Time-Series Modeling (if relevant)

Prompt: “Proceed to Node E.”

Task: Apply mathematical modeling (e.g., ARIMA, Fourier, spectral entropy) if time-based signal patterns are critical.

Only invoke if temporal dynamics or trend modeling is relevant to the question.

Initiate Node C – Consensus Forecast

Prompt: “Proceed to Node C.”

Node C uses internal MSCFT.MS-CMT logic to generate the final forecast.

Must synthesize all relevant upstream nodes (A, B, and optionally D/E).

Output must fully comply with MSCFT format. Do not mention swarm logic in the output.

Check Output Format

Must be plain text only — no ASCII, no markdown tables.

Ensure all formatting follows MSCFT standards exactly.

Optional Use Cases Beyond Forecasting

MSCFT 4.1B may be adapted for:

Red teaming and dissent modeling

Intelligence assessments

Scientific inference with probabilistic uncertainty

AI model behavior analysis (using Node D or E)

Agentic policy simulations

Key Principles:

Always use structured prompting to move sequentially: A → B → (D/E if needed) → C

Clarify logic and framing between nodes — never proceed blindly

The final output must be compliant with the MSCFT 4.1B format

BEST PRACTICE for Running MSCFT 4.1B Forecasts

Refresh Your Chat Session Regularly
Do not use the same GPT-4o thread for multiple days of forecasts. Context drift may degrade logic.

Start a new session

Paste the MSCFT 4.1B Template

Begin the new forecast cleanly

Reassert format compliance:
//* Use MSCFT Template Version 4.1B – SWARM Nodes and BIN Integrated. Plain text. No formatting. No improvisation.

Manually Prompt Through Each Node (A–E)

Always review and question each node before proceeding

Do not let the model jump ahead or collapse steps

This ensures maximum control and prevents logic flaws

Use Plain Text Only

Never allow markdown tables or styled blocks

Keeps output clean, reviewable, and publication-ready

Clarify Version Usage and Node Logic

Always refer to Nodes A–E when applicable

Node D: for interpretation/generalization

Node E: for signal modeling or time-bound inference

BIN model is fully integrated into Node B (no suffix needed)

Tight Instruction Flow
Begin with:

Forecast question

PRAMs

Bucket structure

Then trigger Node A → Node B → (D/E if needed) → Node C
