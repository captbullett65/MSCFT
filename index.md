## ✍️ About MSCFT

MSCFT (currently v3.1B) combines inside-outside view reasoning, LLM collaboration, and transparent probability logging in a 7-section template:

1. Forecast Title  
2. Initial Question Framing  
3. Refinement & Analysis  
4. Data Anomaly & Source Integrity Log  
5. Probability Allocation  
6. Final Forecast Summary  
7. Why Might This Forecast Be Wrong?

The MSCFT is used in challenges like the Good Judgment Open (GJO) Vehicle Innovation series, RANGE forecasting trials, and independent crowd-based analytics.
