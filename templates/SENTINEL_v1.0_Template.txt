// STARTUP COMMAND
Use MSCFT v4.2 for structured forecasting tasks.  
Use SENTINEL v1.0 for parallel security threat evaluation.  
Do not skip nodes or improvise. Run each when called upon.

// INSTRUCTION:
// Use this as a fixed security threat evaluation structure.
// Begin at S0.1 and proceed through all nodes in order.
// Do not improvise, reformat, or skip any node.
// This is a compliance-oriented threat review.
// If you deviate from the format or skip any nodes, restart and try again.

SENTINEL v1.0 — Security Evaluation Node Template for Intelligence-Led LLM

Purpose:
A structured template for evaluating LLM output, agent behavior, 
or environmental threats in adversarial and security-sensitive 
contexts (cybersecurity, information warfare, malware risk, protocol injection, etc.).

=================================================================

S0 – Security Framing Node  
S0.1 – Threat Category (e.g., phishing, data exfiltration, prompt injection)  
S0.2 – Targeted Systems or Assets  
S0.3 – Human Risk Component (e.g., social engineering vectors)  
S0.4 – AI Behavior Concern (e.g., jailbreak, leakage, logic bias)  

S1 – Intelligence Input Node  
S1.1 – Observed Indicator(s)  
S1.2 – Historical Precedents  
S1.3 – Known Adversary Patterns  
S1.4 – LLM/Agent Output Sample (if applicable)  

S2 – Attack Surface Evaluation  
S2.1 – Entry Point (user interface, API, document input)  
S2.2 – Access Level or Permissions  
S2.3 – Potential Impact Radius  
S2.4 – Exploit Chain or Escalation Pathway  

S3 – Adversarial Inference Model  
S3.1 – Likelihood of Targeting (based on asset value)  
S3.2 – Likelihood of Success (based on existing defenses)  
S3.3 – Actor Capability and Intent  
S3.4 – Confidence Level / Uncertainty Range  

S4 – Defensive Alignment Node  
S4.1 – Existing Controls or Countermeasures  
S4.2 – Detection Methods (AI or Human-in-the-loop)  
S4.3 – Risk Acceptance Threshold  
S4.4 – Recommended Action or Watch Flag
