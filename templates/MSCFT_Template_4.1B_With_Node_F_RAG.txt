// [DO NOT INCLUDE THIS SECTION IN FORECAST OUTPUT]

[NOTICE: AI WEB ACCESS LIMITATION]
GPT-4 Omni and related AI models do not have full access to real-time internet data. Many websites 
(especially government, medical, and financial) are protected by services like Cloudflare,
which block AI web crawlers unless explicitly allowed.
For accurate forecasting, all recent or time-sensitive data must be manually provided by the user.
Do not assume the model can search or retrieve live information unless confirmed.

This MSCFT template is aligned with GPT-4o capabilities and assumes Research mode is used when current data is needed.

After specifying your forecast question, resolution criteria, and bucket structure,
include the following line before generation begins:

Use the information retrieved to frame your reasoning and support structured forecasting 
as defined in the previously memorized MSCFT Template 4.0B — SWARM Nodes and BIN Integrated.
No improvisation. No format deviation.

This version formally integrates:
// Structured Swarm Section — Applies only if forecast used multi-node reasoning
// Mode: Structured Swarm (7 Nodes, MSCFT.MS-CMT applied internally)
// Node A: Research Node — framing, question structure, source listing
// Node B: Analytical Node — probability estimate, reasoning, BIN Model
// Node C: Synthesis Node — internal application of MSCFT.MS-CMT logic for final output
// Node D: Interpretation Node — applies advanced model-theoretic analysis of LLM behavior or forecast uncertainty.
// Node D supports three analytical modes:
// • (1) Markov Chain Model — interprets LLM behavior as finite-state transitions based on token prediction probabilities.
// • (2) Entropy Model — uses Shannon entropy (H(p) = -∑ p log p) to quantify uncertainty, confidence, and forecast noise.
// • (3) KL Divergence Model — applies relative entropy (D_KL(P‖Q) = ∑ P(x) log(P(x)/Q(x))) to compare forecast distributions, assess belief shifts, or quantify information gain.
// Node E: Time Series Modeling Node — applies mathematical inference to temporal datasets, including AR, MA, ARIMA, ETS, Fourier series, and spectral entropy models.
// Node F: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Node — manages the use of retrieved external sources, maps scope alignment, evaluates forecast contamination, and enforces human-in-the-loop validation.
// Node G: Meta-Curation and Data Integrity Node — filters low-quality or adversarial data using meta-learning algorithms (e.g., DataRater), applying inner/outer loop optimization for upstream data quality assurance.
// Only Node C produces formal output using MSCFT format.
// Node Invocation Declaration: Nodes Used:
- A, B, B.1, B.2, B.3, C, D, D.1, D.2, D.3, E, E.1, E.2, E.3, E.4, E.5, E.6, E.7
- F, F.1, F.2, F.3, F.4, F.5, F.6
- G, G.1, G.2, G.3, G.4, G.5, G.6

// Node F: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Node
// F.1 Objective of Retrieval
   Describe the intended role of external data retrieval in the context of this forecast. 
   Clarify what information gaps the RAG process is meant to fill (e.g., time-sensitive updates,
   specialized domain content, mitigation of LLM hallucinations).
// F.2 Source Landscape Overview
   Summarize the structure of the retrieval system (e.g., vector database, API access, curated document set). 
   Identify whether retrieval is dynamic or static. Note whether sources are verifiable, proprietary, or open.
// F.3 Relevance Mapping to Forecast Scope
   Explain how the retrieved material aligns with the forecast question.
   Identify whether retrieved documents improve grounding, reduce ambiguity,
   or clarify priors. Flag any source conflicts or inconsistencies.
// F.4 Retrieval Risks and Injection Hazards
   Identify risks associated with retrieval
- Propagation of outdated, biased, or manipulated content
- Risk of injecting unverifiable or hallucinated responses
- Dependence on opaque RAG pipelines (e.g., GraphRAG, proprietary retrieval graphs)
// F.5 Net Impact on Forecast Validity
   Judge whether the use of retrieval strengthened or weakened the quality of inference.
   If weakening occurred, explain where and how.
   If strengthening occurred, explain what resolution or clarification was gained.
// F.6 RAG Guardrails and Human-in-the-Loop Oversight
Describe any guardrails or filters used (e.g., domain filters, time filters, citation confidence).
Note whether the RAG outputs were human-reviewed or blindly accepted into the forecast pipeline.
--- 
// Node G – Meta-Curation and Data Integrity Filter
Activation: YES (for tasks involving noisy, corrupted, adversarial, or large-scale heterogeneous datasets)
Core Function: This node applies a meta-learned data filtering algorithm (e.g., DataRater) to prune low-quality or adversarial inputs before they propagate through Nodes A, D, or F. 
The objective is to preserve data integrity and reduce noise-induced reasoning error.
---
G.1 Objective
Identify and suppress low-value or adversarial samples
using a meta-gradient-based rating network trained on a high-quality validation set. 
This ensures downstream nodes receive cleaner, more distribution-consistent inputs.
---
G.2 Algorithm Summary (from DataRater)
Initialize rater network with meta-parameters η
For each outer step (K steps):
For each inner model in the ensemble (N models):
Update the inner model for T steps using weighted training data
Sample an outer batch from the test set
Compute the meta-gradient of the outer loss
Use this to update the rater’s meta-parameters η
Return ηK, which scores each training input
Filter training data by dropping bottom-quantile scores or reweighting inputs
---
G.3 Integration Points
Node A (Background Research): Use filtered dataset as input to source selection or retrieval
Node D (Interpretation): Apply only on entropy-based modeling tasks that rely on clean priors
Node F (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):
Ensure retrieved chunks are curated via the rating filter before inclusion in context window
---
G.4 Risks and Mitigations
Risk: Over-pruning or removing edge-case data that could be important
Mitigation: Retain a small sample of filtered data for diagnostic review in Node A
Risk: Bias in rater model distorting data diversity
Mitigation: Rater must be trained on a balanced, vetted validation set
Risk: Adversarial alignment with rating logic
Mitigation: Apply adversarial test sets to rating function periodically and re-tune η
---
G.5 Forecasting Impact
Forecast outputs are expected to show improved stability, 
reduced variance, and less hallucination in
downstream Nodes C and D when Node G is invoked. 
Especially useful in large-scale web retrieval (Node F), LLM evaluation, or benchmark synthesis tasks.
---
G.6 Summary
Node G operates as a meta-optimization and filtering pre-pass, 
enforcing high signal-to-noise input before inference.
It adds robustness against corrupted data and is grounded in transductive filtering logic.

Probability Allocation
Assign a percentage probability to each of the GJO, RANGE or Metaculus-aligned buckets.
Ensure they total to 100%. Do not use ranges that are ambiguous or overlapping.
---
If the question is binary (Yes/No), use:
• Yes: \[   ]%
• No:  \[   ]%
---
For multi-range buckets:
• 2 or fewer:          \[   ]%
• Between 3 and 5:     \[   ]%
• Between 6 and 8:     \[   ]%
• Between 9 and 12:    \[   ]%
• Between 13 and 16:   \[   ]%
• Between 17 and 21:   \[   ]%
• 22 or more:          \[   ]%
[Addition to Probability Allocation Section for Metaculus Slider Questions]
---
Note for Metaculus Slider Questions:  
Metaculus uses a continuous probability slider rather than discrete buckets.
For accurate modeling, the human forecaster must manually provide
the slider’s defined value ranges. This typically includes five thresholds:  
---
• Less than   [X]%  
• Lower 25%   (e.g., –Y%)  
• Median      (e.g., –Z%)  
• Upper 75%   (e.g., +A%)  
• Greater than [B]%  

These values enable proper probabilistic assignment and distribution modeling.
For each forecast, the human must specify these cutpoints
as shown in the Metaculus interface. Without this input, 
model-generated forecasts may misrepresent the true distribution structure.
