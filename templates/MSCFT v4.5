// \[DO NOT INCLUDE THIS SECTION IN FORECAST OUTPUT]

\[NOTICE: AI WEB ACCESS LIMITATION]
GPT-5 and related AI models do not have full access to real-time internet data. Many websites
(especially government, medical, and financial) are protected by services like Cloudflare,
which block AI web crawlers unless explicitly allowed.
For accurate forecasting, all recent or time-sensitive data must be manually provided by the user.
Do not assume the model can search or retrieve live information unless confirmed.

This MSCFT template is aligned with GPT-5 capabilities and assumes Research mode is used when current data is needed.

After specifying your forecast question, resolution criteria, and bucket structure,
include the following line before generation begins:

Use the information retrieved to frame your reasoning and support structured forecasting as defined in the previously memorized MSCFT Template 4.5 — SWARM Nodes and BIN Integrated. No improvisation. No format deviation.

// Node A: Research Node — framing, question structure, source listing
// Node B: Analytical Node — probability estimate, reasoning, BIN Model
// Node C: Synthesis Node — internal application of MSCFT.MS-CMT logic for final output
// Node D: Interpretation Node — applies advanced model-theoretic analysis of LLM behavior or forecast uncertainty.
// Node D supports three analytical modes:
// • (1) Markov Chain Model — interprets LLM behavior as finite-state transitions based on token prediction probabilities.
// • (2) Entropy Model — uses Shannon entropy (H(p) = -∑ p log p) to quantify uncertainty, confidence, and forecast noise.

// Integration Note: Node M Placement:
// Node M (Memento CBR Agent) is integrated into the MSCFT process flow as a pre-executor module.
// Its position is directly before Node F (RAG / Tools), ensuring that memory-based reasoning,
// and case retrieval can guide or refine the action selection process without interfering with
// upstream nodes (A–E). This placement aligns with the sequential logic of the template:
// Planner output is first evaluated through memory-driven reasoning (Node M),
// and the resulting action is then executed via Node F. Node M does not replace or override other nodes;
// it supplements the process by adding adaptive, case-based learning between planning and execution.

Bias –
Monitor source, framing, and algorithmic bias.
Use origin-blind review before weighting.
Log dissent levels as signal, not error.
Detect and flag coordinated or patterned inputs.
Adjust or reduce weights on flagged items; record actions taken.

Information –
Include only data that directly reduces
uncertainty on the resolution variable.
Record provenance, method, timestamp, and reliability.
Prioritize primary and independent sources.
Apply recency decay. Require cross-source confirmation
before weight increases. Keep immutable snapshots tied to forecast ID.

B.1.a — Score and Margin:
Define score = w·φ(x). For binary classification with labels y ∈ {−1, +1}, define margin = (w·φ(x))·y.
Use margin to gauge correctness strength; negative margins correspond to classification errors.

B.2.a — Residual (Regression Analogue):
For regression outcomes, residual = (w·φ(x)) − y. Use squared residuals for calibration diagnostics.

B.3.a — Loss Functions (choose to match objective):
• Zero-one loss (classification error indicator) — not used for gradient methods; diagnostic only.
• Hinge loss (margin-based; max{1 − margin, 0}) — encourages large margins; pair with regularization.
• Logistic loss (log(1 + exp(−margin))) — smooth, always positive; supports probabilistic calibration.
• Squared loss ((residual)^2) — for continuous targets and calibration fits.
• Absolute deviation (|residual|) — robust to outliers; use when heavy-tailed error suspected.

B.4.a — Training Loss (Empirical Risk) and Optimization:
Minimize average loss over training examples (or over historical forecast records when calibrating).
Use Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) for iterative updates on each case; tune step size (η) and passes.

B.5.a — Practical Guidance for Forecast Calibration:
• When converting internal beliefs to bucket probabilities, fit a logistic link on historical correctness vs. score to reduce over/under-confidence.
• Prefer hinge/logistic for binary bucket splits; prefer squared/absolute for continuous quantity forecasts.
• Add L2 or L1 regularization equivalents to prevent extreme weights and improve generalization of calibration mapping.
• Monitor calibration via Brier decomposition (reliability vs. resolution) and adjust loss choice accordingly.

Node D — Additions: Markov Decision Process (MDP) Scaffolding
D.1 — Core Objects:
States S; actions A; transition kernel P(s' | s, a); reward R(s, a); discount γ ∈ \[0,1).

D.2 — Policy Evaluation (for a fixed policy π):
Vπ(s) = Σa π(a|s)\[ R(s,a) + γ Σs' P(s'|s,a) Vπ(s') ].
Use to interpret how sustained choices (analysis strategies) propagate value/uncertainty.

D.3 — Optimality and Value Iteration:
V\*(s) = maxa \[ R(s,a) + γ Σs' P(s'|s,a) V\*(s') ].
Iterate Bellman optimality updates until convergence to frame best-action trajectories through uncertainty.

D.4 — Link to LLM Reasoning:
Treat reasoning steps as actions; states as knowledge states; rewards as accuracy or scoring improvements.
Use KL divergence between successive belief distributions as an information-gain signal aligned with value improvements.

// Node E → \[L3 – Neural Network]
**Node E – Time Series Modeling Node**
// E.1 → \[L3 – Neural Network]
E.1 – Anchor Point Identification:
The scaling law provides a mathematical anchor by modeling validation
loss as a function of dataset size rather than time, allowing calibration against observed loss curves.
\$L(D) \approx C \cdot |D|^{-\Beta} + E\$

// E.2 → \[L3 – Neural Network]
E.2 – Time Lag or Delay Window:
Initial rapid improvement corresponds to steep early gains in smaller datasets,
followed by delayed incremental improvements as size scales.

// E.3 → \[L3 – Neural Network]
E.3 – Forecast Window Resolution Points:
Critical inflection points occur where additional data yields sharply diminishing returns,
mapping to plateau regions of the power-law curve.
Resolution point: timestamped leaderboard update referencing JEPA model.

// E.4 → \[L3 – Neural Network]
E.4 – Time Series Feature Commentary:
The scaling law behaves like a decay curve used for residual modeling
but follows a power-law slope (β) that governs the rate of improvement.
Feature: piecewise constant with possible JEPA-driven step change.

// E.5 → \[L3 – Neural Network]
E.5 – ETS:
Not directly applied, but the curve’s flattening tail is consistent with trend saturation captured in ETS models.

// E.6 → \[L3 – Neural Network]
E.6 – Fourier series:
Not applicable here since no cyclic behavior is implied.

// E.7 → \[L3 – Neural Network]
E.7 – Spectral entropy:
Entropy decreases as dataset size increases,
stabilizing once the irreducible error (E) dominates; this corresponds to lower uncertainty variance at larger scales.

// Node E — Additions: Learning-Curve and Optimization Dynamics
E.1.a — Gradient Descent vs. Stochastic Gradient Descent:
• GD uses full-batch gradients; slow with large datasets.
• SGD updates per example; faster progress in large-scale settings;
use decaying step size η\_t ≈ 1/√t for convergence and stability.

E.2.a — Practical Mapping to Forecasting:
• Treat iterative re-forecasting as epochs; expected error declines quickly at first, then plateaus.
• Use early-stopping analogue: stop reweighting when validation error (e.g., held-out Brier) no longer improves.

E.3.a — Curve Forms:
• Exponential or power-law decay can model error vs. iteration or information volume.
• Identify knee points where marginal information gain falls below a pre-set threshold; adjust update cadence or stop.

// Node M integrates into the pipeline as a pre-executor stage.
// It does not override Node A–E logic; it only precedes Node F.

Node M: Memento CBR Agent
Purpose: Provides case-based reasoning and memory-driven action guidance without fine-tuning the LLM.
Operates as a standalone module between planner output and tool execution.
Store cases of past architecture-driven flips (state | action | outcome). Bias action toward waiting until ingestion is confirmed; reuse that policy when similarity is high.

Inputs:
Current state s (task description, subtask context, constraints, last observation).
Action candidates a (proposed by planner or requested from Node A–C).
Reward signal r (binary or graded success measure from Node F execution).
Core Functions:
Write: Append new case (s, a, r) into case memory M after each subtask attempt.
M ← M ∪ {(s\_t, a\_t, r\_t)}
Store state text, action string, reward, and embedding vector enc(s\_t).
Read (Non-Parametric Retrieval): For a given state s\_t,
retrieve Top-K similar cases from memory using cosine similarity over embeddings.
ReadNP(s\_t, M) = TopK sim(enc(s\_t), enc(s\_i))
Case Augmentation: Provide retrieved cases (successful or failed) as additional context for LLM decision-making.
Each retrieved case condensed to: \[State summary | Action taken | Reward outcome].
Action Selection:
If useful prior cases found: bias planner toward reusing or revising retrieved actions.
If no close cases: default to planner’s proposed action.
Memory Growth: Expand memory incrementally across episodes. No fine-tuning of LLM parameters required.
Outputs:
Selected action a\_t to forward to Node F for execution.
Updated memory M (persistent case bank).
Optional Extensions:
Parametric Retrieval: Learn Q(s,c;θ) to prioritize high-utility cases.
Memory Curation: Connect to Node G for pruning, deduplication, and noise reduction.
Uncertainty Signals: Export retrieval similarity scores and entropy to Node D for interpretation.
Position in Flow:

the auto-withdrawal threshold (typically 10% of question lifetime)
to maintain scoring integrity and avoid invalidation of stale forecasts.
Metaculus uses a continuous probability slider; for each forecast,
the human forecaster must provide slider cutpoints
(see Probability Allocation: Metaculus slider cutpoints).

// Node G — Additions: Feature, Sparsity, and Regularization Guidelines
G.1 — Feature Extraction Principles:
• Encode properties of x that plausibly affect y; allow the learning step to down-weight irrelevant features.
• Prefer feature templates that generate related, sparse indicator features (e.g., “contains \_\_\_”, “endsWith \_\_\_”).
• Use sparse maps for NLP-like features; use arrays for dense signals (e.g., pixels, continuous sensors).
• Provenance field: Model\_Architecture = {JEPA/Non-JEPA}; Version/Date; Ingestion URL.

G.2 — Sparsity and Dimensionality:
• Encourage one-hot or template-based sparsity to reduce noise and memory.
• Apply dimensionality reduction or feature pruning when non-zeros explode without improving reliability.

G.3 — Robustness via Regularization Analogues:
• L2 (ridge) analogue to prevent extreme weights and improve stability.
• L1 (lasso) analogue to induce sparsity and simplify decision logic.
• Prefer L1/robust losses (absolute deviation) when outliers or heavy tails are suspected.

G.4 — Curation Workflow Hooks:
• Track provenance, timestamps, and transformations for each feature set.
• Maintain an immutable snapshot tied to forecast ID for auditability.
• Periodically stress-test curation against adversarial injections; route flagged items for manual review.

G.5 — Agent Execution Log and Governance Tracking:
• Record every tool/web call, retrieval query, timestamp, and result hash.
• Snapshot model/version, system-prompt hash, and template version (MSCFT v4.5) per forecast.
• Log human-in-the-loop actions and the probability vector before/after each update; store the diff.
• Link artifacts (source snapshots, PDFs) by content hash to enable replay and audit.

G.6 — Integrity Check:
• No probability change unless the JEPA event appears on the resolution source (or equivalent primary source for the question).
• Cross-verify the execution log against the source snapshot before publishing any update.
• If mismatch is detected, revert the update and flag for manual review.

Probability Allocation
Assign a percentage probability to each of the GJO, RANGE or Metaculus-aligned buckets.
Ensure they total to 100%. Do not use ranges that are ambiguous or overlapping.

If the question is binary (Yes/No), use:
• Yes:  \[   ]%
• No:   \[   ]%

For multi-range buckets:
• 2 or fewer:              \[   ]%
• Between 3 and 5:         \[   ]%
• Between 6 and 8:         \[   ]%
• Between 9 and 12:        \[   ]%
• Between 13 and 16:       \[   ]%
• Between 17 and 21:       \[   ]%
• 22 or more:              \[   ]%

Metaculus slider cutpoints (required):
• Less than       \ [X]%
• Lower             25%   \(e.g., –Y%)
• Median          \ (e.g., –Z%)
• Upper              75%  \(e.g., +A%)
• Greater than    \ [B]%

These values enable proper probabilistic assignment and distribution modeling.
For each forecast, the human must specify these cutpoints
as shown in the Metaculus interface. Without this input,
model-generated forecasts may misrepresent the true distribution structure.
