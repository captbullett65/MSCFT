// [DO NOT INCLUDE THIS SECTION IN FORECAST OUTPUT]

[NOTICE: AI WEB ACCESS LIMITATION]
GPT-4 Omni and related AI models do not have full access to real-time internet data. Many websites 
(especially government, medical, and financial) are protected by services like Cloudflare,
which block AI web crawlers unless explicitly allowed.
For accurate forecasting, all recent or time-sensitive data must be manually provided by the user.
Do not assume the model can search or retrieve live information unless confirmed.

This MSCFT template is aligned with GPT-4o capabilities and assumes Research mode is used when current data is needed.

After specifying your forecast question, resolution criteria, and bucket structure,
include the following line before generation begins:

Use the information retrieved to frame your reasoning and support structured forecasting 
as defined in the previously memorized MSCFT Template 4.0B — SWARM Nodes and BIN Integrated.
No improvisation. No format deviation.

This version formally integrates:
• Node A – Research (framing, structure, sourcing)
• Node B – Analytical (probability, BIN reasoning)
• Node C – Synthesis (MSCFT.MS-CMT logic)
• Node D – Model Behavior (interprets LLMs as Markov chains over finite state space; evaluates generalization and inference quality)

Only Node C outputs the final forecast. All logic must conform to MSCFT Template 4.0B structure.

MSCFT Template (Version 4.0 B SWARM nodes and BIN Integrated)

Forecast Title: \[Insert Forecast Title Here]
Forecaster: \[Insert Forecaster Name Here]

Initial Question Framing
Question: \[Insert your forecasting question here.]
Clarifications:
• \[Insert relevant details about dates, participants, key conditions, or assumptions.]
• \[Insert any known results, baselines, or thresholds.]
• \[Insert any poll data, prior trends, or framing context.]
Key Sources:
• \[Source 1]
• \[Source 2]
• \[Source 3]
• \[Add more as needed]

Refinement & Analysis
Key Developments:
• \[Summarize major events or dynamics relevant to the forecast question.]
• \[Note polling trends, market behavior, public sentiment, or institutional actions.]
• \[Include controversies, endorsements, or strategic shifts if relevant.]
Interpretation:
\[Explain how the developments influence your forecast. Discuss possible pathways, leverage points, or conditional dependencies. Summarize why you're leaning a certain way.]

Note: If the forecast outcome is near a bucket threshold, consider hedging your probabilities across adjacent bins to avoid overconfidence. Overweighting a single bucket—even if correct—can result in a poor Brier score if the outcome lies near the edge.

Inside-Outside View Structuring
Inside View: \[Insert short-term or domain-specific reasoning from known context.]
Outside View: \[Insert baseline rates, historic cases, or comparative reference classes.]

Data Anomaly & Source Integrity Log
Date Range Affected: \[Insert applicable date range]
Observed Anomaly: \[Describe any unusual or inconsistent data]
Identified Cause: \[Explain known or suspected reason for the anomaly]
Implication for Forecast: \[Describe the forecast impact if any]
Action Taken: \[Describe any adjustment or caveat added due to this anomaly]

// Structured Swarm Section — Applies only if forecast used multi-node reasoning
// Mode: Structured Swarm (3 Nodes, MSCFT.MS-CMT applied internally)
// Node A: Research Node — framing, question structure, source listing
// Node B: Analytical Node — probability estimate, reasoning, BIN Model
// Node C: Synthesis Node — internal application of MSCFT.MS-CMT logic for final output
// Node D: Interpreting LLMs as Markov chains and the implications for generalization and performance
// Only Node C produces formal output using MSCFT format

Probability Allocation
\[Assign a percentage probability to each of the GJO-aligned buckets. Ensure they total to 100%. Do not use ranges that are not approved.]

Note: If the question is binary (Yes/No), replace the bucketed probability ranges with:
• Yes: \[   ]%
• No: \[   ]%
Ensure the total is 100%.

• 2 or fewer: \[   ]%
• Between 3 and 5: \[   ]%
• Between 6 and 8: \[   ]%
• Between 9 and 12: \[   ]%
• Between 13 and 16: \[   ]%
• Between 17 and 21: \[   ]%
• 22 or more: \[   ]%
Ensure the total is 100%.

Rationale:
\[Briefly explain the reasoning behind your distribution. Why is each range plausible or implausible? What data or signals support your weightings?]

BIN MODEL (Bias, Information, Noise)

Bias –
Describe any systemic, institutional, cognitive, or structural biases that may influence the interpretation of the forecast question, its underlying data, or scenario framing. Address both source bias (e.g., media, academic, or policy bias) and forecaster bias (e.g., optimism/pessimism, threat inflation, anchoring on prior outcomes).

Information –
Assess the quality, timeliness, resolution, and credibility of the information used. Clearly distinguish between confirmed data, predictive model output, outdated information, unverifiable claims, or speculation. Note any critical gaps or overreliance on a narrow set of sources.

Noise –
Identify irrelevant, misleading, or low-signal data that may contaminate the forecasting logic. This includes information clutter, cherry-picked examples, emotionally charged narratives, or recency bias. Describe where noise may distort scenario weighting or probability distribution

Final Forecast Summary
Forecast: \[Summarize the most likely outcome and your top bucket(s)]
Explanation: \[Summarize how this forecast fits the overall strategic context]

Why Might You Be Wrong?

1. \[Insert potential forecast error #1, e.g., unexpected policy changes or global events]
2. \[Insert potential forecast error #2, e.g., misreading of trend strength or timing]
3. \[Insert potential forecast error #3, e.g., data quality issues or blind spots]
