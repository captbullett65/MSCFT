[DO NOT INCLUDE THIS SECTION IN FORECAST OUTPUT]

This MSCFT template is aligned with GPT-4o capabilities and assumes Research mode is used when current data is needed.

After specifying your forecast question, resolution criteria, and bucket structure, include the following line before generation begins:

Use the information retrieved to frame your reasoning and support structured forecasting as defined in the previously memorized MSCFT Template 3.1B – BIN Integrated. No improvisation. No format deviation.

## Probability Allocation  

**Outcome:**  
[Brief description of what is being forecasted]

**Probability:**  
[Assign probability across buckets or binary options]

**Rationale:**  
[Explain the reasoning behind your probability allocation]

### If using bucketed forecast:

- 2 or fewer: [ ]%  
- Between 3 and 5: [ ]%  
- Between 6 and 8: [ ]%  
- Between 9 and 12: [ ]%  
- Between 13 and 16: [ ]%  
- Between 17 and 21: [ ]%  
- 22 or more: [ ]%  

**Ensure the total is 100%.**

### If binary (Yes/No):

- Yes: [ ]%  
- No: [ ]%  

**Ensure the total is 100%.**

BIN MODEL (Bias, Information, Noise)

Bias –
Describe any systemic, institutional, cognitive, or structural biases that may influence the interpretation of the forecast question, its underlying data, or scenario framing. Address both source bias (e.g., media, academic, or policy bias) and forecaster bias (e.g., optimism/pessimism, threat inflation, anchoring on prior outcomes).

Information –
Assess the quality, timeliness, resolution, and credibility of the information used. Clearly distinguish between confirmed data, predictive model output, outdated information, unverifiable claims, or speculation. Note any critical gaps or overreliance on a narrow set of sources.

Noise –
Identify irrelevant, misleading, or low-signal data that may contaminate the forecasting logic. This includes information clutter, cherry-picked examples, emotionally charged narratives, or recency bias. Describe where noise may distort scenario weighting or probability distribution

## Final Forecast Summary  

**Forecast:**  
[State your most likely outcome clearly.]

**Explanation:**  
[Summarize your reasoning and what you think the most important variables are.]

---

## Why Might This Forecast Be Wrong?

### Inside View (Scenario/Assumption Bias)  
[What might you be getting wrong in your logic, assumptions, timeline, or confidence?]

### Outside View (Base Rate / Historical Anomaly Risk)  
[What does the historical or comparative case suggest might make this forecast wrong? Base rates, black swan risks, or error in data trends?]
