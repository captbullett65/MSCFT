Forecast Title: \[Insert Forecast Title Here]
Forecaster: \[Insert Forecaster Name Here]

Initial Question Framing
Question: \[Insert your forecasting question here.]
Clarifications:
• \[Insert relevant details about dates, participants, key conditions, or assumptions.]
• \[Insert any known results, baselines, or thresholds.]
• \[Insert any poll data, prior trends, or framing context.]
Key Sources:
• \[Source 1]
• \[Source 2]
• \[Source 3]
• \[Add more as needed]

Refinement & Analysis
Key Developments:
• \[Summarize major events or dynamics relevant to the forecast question.]
• \[Note polling trends, market behavior, public sentiment, or institutional actions.]
• \[Include controversies, endorsements, or strategic shifts if relevant.]
Interpretation:
\[Explain how the developments influence your forecast. Discuss possible pathways, leverage points, or conditional dependencies. Summarize why you're leaning a certain way.]

Note: If the forecast outcome is near a bucket threshold, consider hedging your probabilities across adjacent bins to avoid overconfidence. Overweighting a single bucket—even if correct—can result in a poor Brier score if the outcome lies near the edge.

Inside-Outside View Structuring
Inside View: \[Insert short-term or domain-specific reasoning from known context.]
Outside View: \[Insert baseline rates, historic cases, or comparative reference classes.]

// Structured Swarm Section — Applies only if forecast used multi-node reasoning
// Mode: Structured Swarm (5 Nodes, MSCFT.MS-CMT applied internally)
// Node A: Research Node — framing, question structure, source listing
// Node B: Analytical Node — probability estimate, reasoning
//   Node B.2: BIN Model Substructure (Bias, Information, Noise)
// Node C: Synthesis Node — applies MSCFT.MS-CMT logic
//   Node C.2: Final Forecast Summary
//   Node C.3: Rationale for Probability Distribution
//   Node C.4: Forecast Caveats and Error Pathways
//   Only Node C may output the final forecast in structured format
// Node D: Interpretation Node — applies Markov chain, entropy, or KL divergence models to interpret LLM generalization, inference behavior, or uncertainty
//   (1) Markov Chain Model — models finite-state transitions of token prediction
//   (2) Entropy Model — uses Shannon entropy H(p) = –∑ p log p
//   (3) KL Divergence Model — D\_KL(P‖Q) = ∑ P(x) log(P(x)/Q(x))
//   Node D.3: Optional Symbolic Logic Structures (used for internal LLM reasoning trace): Stack, Trie, Tree, Graph
// Node E: Time Series Modeling Node — applies mathematical modeling for temporal or signal-based inference
//   Methods include:
//     E.1 AR
//     E.2 MA
//     E.3 ARIMA
//     E.4 SARIMA
//     E.5 ETS
//     E.6 Fourier series
//     E.7 Spectral entropy

Probability Allocation
Assign a percentage probability to each of the GJO, RANGE or Metaculus-aligned buckets. Ensure they total to 100%. Do not use ranges that are ambiguous or overlapping.

If the question is binary (Yes/No), use:
• Yes: \[   ]%
• No: \[   ]%

For multi-range buckets:
• 2 or fewer:          \[   ]%
• Between 3 and 5:     \[   ]%
• Between 6 and 8:     \[   ]%
• Between 9 and 12:    \[   ]%
• Between 13 and 16:   \[   ]%
• Between 17 and 21:   \[   ]%
• 22 or more:          \[   ]%

// Node B.2: BIN Model Substructure (Bias, Information, Noise)
Bias –
\[Describe systemic, institutional, cognitive, or structural biases.]

Information –
