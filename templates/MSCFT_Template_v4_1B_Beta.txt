// [DO NOT INCLUDE THIS SECTION IN FORECAST OUTPUT]

[NOTICE: AI WEB ACCESS LIMITATION]
GPT-4 Omni and related AI models do not have full access to real-time internet data. Many websites 
(especially government, medical, and financial) are protected by services like Cloudflare,
which block AI web crawlers unless explicitly allowed.
For accurate forecasting, all recent or time-sensitive data must be manually provided by the user.
Do not assume the model can search or retrieve live information unless confirmed.

This MSCFT template is aligned with GPT-4o capabilities and assumes Research mode is used when current data is needed.

After specifying your forecast question, resolution criteria, and bucket structure,
include the following line before generation begins:

Use the information retrieved to frame your reasoning and support structured forecasting 
as defined in the previously memorized MSCFT Template 4.0B — SWARM Nodes and BIN Integrated.
No improvisation. No format deviation.

This node contains the foundational time series equations
used within the MSCFT 4.1B Beta template for signal- or temporal-based inference logic.

### 1. Autoregressive (AR) Model

$$
X_t = c + \sum_{i=1}^{p} \phi_i X_{t-i} + \epsilon_t
$$

Where:
- \( X_t \) is the time series at time \( t \)
- \( c \) is a constant
- \( \phi_i \) are the autoregressive coefficients
- \( \epsilon_t \) is white noise

---

### 2. Moving Average (MA) Model

$$
X_t = \mu + \sum_{j=1}^{q} \theta_j \epsilon_{t-j} + \epsilon_t
$$

Where:
- \( \mu \) is the mean of the series
- \( \theta_j \) are the moving average coefficients
- \( \epsilon_t \) is the white noise error

---

### 3. ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average)

$$
\Delta^d X_t = c + \sum_{i=1}^{p} \phi_i \Delta^d X_{t-i} + \sum_{j=1}^{q} \theta_j \epsilon_{t-j} + \epsilon_t
$$

Where:
- \( \Delta^d \) is the differencing operator applied \( d \) times
- The rest as defined above

---

### 4. Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA)

$$
\Phi_p(B^s) \phi_p(B) \Delta^d \Delta_s^D X_t = \Theta_q(B^s) \theta_q(B) \epsilon_t
$$

Where:
- \( B \) is the backshift operator
- \( s \) is the seasonal period
- \( \Delta_s^D \) is the seasonal differencing operator

---

### 5. Exponential Smoothing (ETS)

#### Additive form:

$$
\hat{X}_{t+1} = \ell_t + b_t
$$

$$
\ell_t = \alpha X_t + (1 - \alpha)(\ell_{t-1} + b_{t-1})
$$

$$
b_t = \beta (\ell_t - \ell_{t-1}) + (1 - \beta) b_{t-1}
$$

Where:
- \( \ell_t \) is the level
- \( b_t \) is the trend
- \( \alpha, \beta \) are smoothing parameters

---

### 6. Fourier Series for Seasonal Decomposition

$$
X_t = \mu + \sum_{k=1}^{K} \left[ a_k \cos\left( \frac{2\pi kt}{T} \right) + b_k \sin\left( \frac{2\pi kt}{T} \right) \right] + \epsilon_t
$$

Where:
- \( T \) is the period
- \( K \) is the number of harmonics

---

### 7. Spectral Entropy (Discretized)

$$
H = - \sum_{i=1}^{N} p_i \log(p_i)
$$

Where:
- \( p_i \) is the normalized power in frequency bin \( i \)
- \( H \) approximates the entropy of a time-frequency signal (used for uncertainty analysis)

Forecast Title: \[Insert Forecast Title Here]
Forecaster: \[Insert Forecaster Name Here]

Initial Question Framing
Question: \[Insert your forecasting question here.]
Clarifications:
• \[Insert relevant details about dates, participants, key conditions, or assumptions.]
• \[Insert any known results, baselines, or thresholds.]
• \[Insert any poll data, prior trends, or framing context.]
Key Sources:
• \[Source 1]
• \[Source 2]
• \[Source 3]
• \[Add more as needed]

Refinement & Analysis
Key Developments:
• \[Summarize major events or dynamics relevant to the forecast question.]
• \[Note polling trends, market behavior, public sentiment, or institutional actions.]
• \[Include controversies, endorsements, or strategic shifts if relevant.]
Interpretation:
\[Explain how the developments influence your forecast. Discuss possible pathways, leverage points, or conditional dependencies. Summarize why you're leaning a certain way.]

Note: If the forecast outcome is near a bucket threshold, consider hedging your probabilities across adjacent bins to avoid overconfidence. Overweighting a single bucket—even if correct—can result in a poor Brier score if the outcome lies near the edge.

Probability Allocation  
\Assign a percentage probability to each of the GJO-aligned buckets. Ensure they total to 100%. Do not use ranges that are...

Note: If the question is binary (Yes/No), replace the bucketed probability ranges with:
• Yes: \[   ]%
• No: \[   ]%
Ensure the total is 100%.

• 2 or fewer: \[   ]%
• Between 3 and 5: \[   ]%
• Between 6 and 8: \[   ]%
• Between 9 and 12: \[   ]%
• Between 13 and 16: \[   ]%
• Between 17 and 21: \[   ]%
• 22 or more: \[   ]%
Ensure the total is 100%.

Rationale:
\[Briefly explain the reasoning behind your distribution. Why is each range plausible or implausible? What data or signals support your weightings?]

BIN MODEL (Bias, Information, Noise)

Bias –
Describe any systemic, institutional, cognitive, or structural biases that may influence the interpretation of the forecast question, its underlying data, or scenario framing. Address both source bias (e.g., media, academic, or policy bias) and forecaster bias (e.g., optimism/pessimism, threat inflation, anchoring on prior outcomes).

Information –
Assess the quality, timeliness, resolution, and credibility of the information used. Clearly distinguish between confirmed data, predictive model output, outdated information, unverifiable claims, or speculation. Note any critical gaps or overreliance on a narrow set of sources.

Noise –
Identify irrelevant, misleading, or low-signal data that may contaminate the forecasting logic. This includes information clutter, cherry-picked examples, emotionally charged narratives, or recency bias. Describe where noise may distort scenario weighting or probability distribution
