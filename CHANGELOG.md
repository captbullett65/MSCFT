## \[3.1 C - 4.2 ]  - 2025-06-28 / 2025-08-04
Added a header for use with GPT-4o                               

// [DO NOT INCLUDE THIS SECTION IN FORECAST OUTPUT]

[NOTICE: AI WEB ACCESS LIMITATION]
GPT-4 Omni and related AI models do not have full access to real-time internet data. Many websites 
(especially government, medical, and financial) are protected by services like Cloudflare,
which block AI web crawlers unless explicitly allowed.
For accurate forecasting, all recent or time-sensitive data must be manually provided by the user.
Do not assume the model can search or retrieve live information unless confirmed.

This MSCFT template is aligned with GPT-4o capabilities and assumes Research mode is used when current data is needed.

After specifying your forecast question, resolution criteria, and bucket structure,
include the following line before generation begins:

Use the information retrieved to frame your reasoning and support structured forecasting 
as defined in the previously memorized MSCFT Template 4.0B â€” SWARM Nodes and BIN Integrated.
No improvisation. No format deviation.

This version formally integrates:
// Structured Swarm Section â€” Applies only if forecast used multi-node reasoning
// Mode: Structured Swarm (7 Nodes, MSCFT.MS-CMT applied internally)
// Node A: Research Node â€” framing, question structure, source listing
// Node B: Analytical Node â€” probability estimate, reasoning, BIN Model
// Node C: Synthesis Node â€” internal application of MSCFT.MS-CMT logic for final output
// Node D: Interpretation Node â€” applies advanced model-theoretic analysis of LLM behavior or forecast uncertainty.
// Node D supports three analytical modes:
// â€¢ (1) Markov Chain Model â€” interprets LLM behavior as finite-state transitions based on token prediction probabilities.
// â€¢ (2) Entropy Model â€” uses Shannon entropy (H(p) = -âˆ‘ p log p) to quantify uncertainty, confidence, and forecast noise.
// â€¢ (3) KL Divergence Model â€” applies relative entropy (D_KL(Pâ€–Q) = âˆ‘ P(x) log(P(x)/Q(x))) to compare forecast distributions, assess belief shifts, or quantify information gain.
// Node E: Time Series Modeling Node â€” applies mathematical inference to temporal datasets, including AR, MA, ARIMA, ETS, Fourier series, and spectral entropy models.
// Node F: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Node â€” manages the use of retrieved external sources, maps scope alignment, evaluates forecast contamination, and enforces human-in-the-loop validation.
// Node G: Meta-Curation and Data Integrity Node â€” filters low-quality or adversarial data using meta-learning algorithms (e.g., DataRater), applying inner/outer loop optimization for upstream data quality assurance.
// Only Node C produces formal output using MSCFT format.
// Node Invocation Declaration: Nodes Used:
- A, B, B.1, B.2, B.3, C, D, D.1, D.2, D.3, E, E.1, E.2, E.3, E.4, E.5, E.6, E.7
- F, F.1, F.2, F.3, F.4, F.5, F.6
- G, G.1, G.2, G.3, G.4, G.5, G.6

// MSCFT plain mode locked. No formatting. No ASCII. No inline interpretation. And no deviation. No summarization of the template.

MSCFT Template (Version 4.2)

## \[3.1 B] â€“ 2025-05-31

### Fixed

* Corrected Probability Allocation section bucket phrasing for audit alignment.
* Bucket labels now match GJO structure:

  * 2 or fewer
  * Between 3 and 5
  * Between 6 and 8
  * Between 9 and 12
  * Between 13 and 16
  * Between 17 and 21
  * 22 or more

## \[3.1 B] â€“ 2025-05-30

## ðŸ”’ Backups

Historical forecasts and index versions are stored in `/ backup-log.md/ ` as timestamped ZIPs.

MSCFT is maintained to ensure traceability, clarity, and reproducibility in judgment forecasting. Feedback and improvements are welcome via pull requests or issues.
