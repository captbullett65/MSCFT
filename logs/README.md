# Audit & Validation Logs

This folder holds internal audit logs, anomaly notes, and template validation reports for MSCFT entries. These documents support transparency, version tracking, and integrity auditing of forecasts.

## Available Logs

- [Q1 – Right Said FRED 2025](./audit-validation-log-q1-right-said-fred-2025.txt)
- [Q2 – Placeholder Entry](./audit-validation-log-q2-placeholder.txt)
- [Template Compliance Checklist](../templates/mscft-template-structure-checklist.txt)

## Purpose

Each log tracks:
- Structural compliance with MSCFT v3.1B
- Any observed anomalies or formatting deviations
- Metadata about file authorship and modification
- Comments on forecasting rationale clarity and logic

New entries should be added as forecasts are submitted or audited. This log will evolve as additional validation methods and forecast versions are implemented.

For template examples, visit the [Templates Folder](../templates/).
