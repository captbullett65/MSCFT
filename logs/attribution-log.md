# Attribution Integrity Log

**Date:** July 9, 2025  
**Author:** Brian Helip (captbullett65)

## Background
On July 6, 2025, the MSCFT 4.0A framework was published and described by its author, Brian Helip, 
across GitHub and the OpenAI Developer Forum. The framework includes the ABC Node structure, 
BIN model integration, and structured LLM forecasting methodology.

## Misattribution Incident
On July 9, 2025, another user (Paul Bellow) published a forum post using the same framework terminology,
structural logic, and version number — **without attribution**. 
The original post has been flagged and logged.
Paul Bellow's post does not cite the original source, despite appearing after the public release of the MSCFT 4.0A materials.

## Repository Provenance
This GitHub repository is the canonical and timestamped source of MSCFT 4.0A.
All forks, derivative work, or public posts referencing this version or framework must credit this repository and its author.

commit: log Blurb C to Attribution Integrity Log — OpenAI Dev post reinstated confirming MSCFT 4.0A authorship under original GitHub + OSF record
