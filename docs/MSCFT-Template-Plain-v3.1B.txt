Forecast Title: [Insert Forecast Title Here]  
Forecaster: [Insert Forecaster Name Here]  

Initial Question Framing  
Question: [Insert your forecasting question here.]  
Clarifications:  
• [Insert relevant details about dates, participants, key conditions, or assumptions.]  
• [Insert any known results, baselines, or thresholds.]  
• [Insert any poll data, prior trends, or framing context.]  
Key Sources:  
• [Source 1]  
• [Source 2]  
• [Source 3]  
• [Add more as needed]  

Refinement & Analysis  
Key Developments:  
• [Summarize major events or dynamics relevant to the forecast question.]  
• [Note polling trends, market behavior, public sentiment, or institutional actions.]  
• [Include controversies, endorsements, or strategic shifts if relevant.]  
Interpretation:  
[Explain how the developments influence your forecast. Discuss possible pathways, leverage points, or conditional dependencies. Summarize why you're leaning a certain way.]  

Note: If the forecast outcome is near a bucket threshold, consider hedging your probabilities across adjacent bins to avoid overconfidence. Overweighting a single bucket—even if correct—can result in a poor Brier score if the outcome lies near the edge.

Inside-Outside View Structuring  
Inside View: [Insert short-term or domain-specific reasoning from known context.]  
Outside View: [Insert baseline rates, historic cases, or comparative reference classes.]

Data Anomaly & Source Integrity Log  
Date Range Affected: [Insert applicable date range]  
Observed Anomaly: [Describe any unusual or inconsistent data]  
Identified Cause: [Explain known or suspected reason for the anomaly]  
Implication for Forecast: [Describe the forecast impact if any]  
Action Taken: [Describe any adjustment or caveat added due to this anomaly]  

Probability Allocation  
[Assign a percentage probability to each of the GJO-aligned buckets. Ensure they total to 100%. Do not use ranges that are not approved.]

Note: If the question is binary (Yes/No), replace the bucketed probability ranges with:  
• Yes: [   ]%  
• No: [   ]%  
Ensure the total is 100%.

• 2 or fewer: [   ]%  
• Between 3 and 5: [   ]%  
• Between 6 and 8: [   ]%  
• Between 9 and 12: [   ]%  
• Between 13 and 16: [   ]%  
• Between 17 and 21: [   ]%  
• 22 or more: [   ]%  
Ensure the total is 100%.

Rationale:  
[Briefly explain the reasoning behind your distribution. Why is each range plausible or implausible? What data or signals support your weightings?]

Final Forecast Summary  
Forecast: [Summarize the most likely outcome and your top bucket(s)]  
Explanation: [Summarize how this forecast fits the overall strategic context]
