# Attribution Record: MSCFT Influence on Raif (Cultivate Labs, 2025)

## Overview

This document records the observed structural overlap between the **Master SWARM Consensus Forecasting Template (MSCFT)** and the **Raif** framework released by **Cultivate Labs** in 2025.

The MSCFT, developed by Brian Helip (Captbullett), was shared directly with Ben Roesch of Cultivate Labs on **May 29, 2025**, via email and GitHub link ([https://github.com/captbullett65/MSCFT](https://github.com/captbullett65/MSCFT)). Shortly thereafter, Raif was released with several components that closely parallel MSCFT’s agent structure.

## Key Parallels

- ReAct-style reasoning loop (`run! do |conversation_history|`)
- Role-based message and memory logging (`"role" => "user" / "assistant"`)
- Tool-based architecture (e.g., `ModelTools::WikipediaSearch`)
- Modular system prompts and task-specific agents
- JSON/HTML structured outputs with schema enforcement
- Real-time LLM feedback streaming (Turbo Streams)

## Attribution Purpose

This file serves to document the MSCFT’s **influence on production-level multi-agent LLM tooling**, affirming its value as a forecasting and reasoning framework.
