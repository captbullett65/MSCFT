# How to Use the MSCFT (Master SWARM Consensus Forecasting Template)

The Master SWARM Consensus Forecasting Template (MSCFT) is a structured forecasting framework for clear,
auditable, and explainable predictions.
It is designed for both independent forecasters and collaborative teams — 
especially when working alongside large language models (LLMs).

## Key Use Cases
- Good Judgment Open, Range, RAND (RFI), Metaculus, and IARPA (crowdsourcing) projects  
- Personal forecasting or journaling  
- Strategic scenario planning or risk modeling  
- Academic and research environments

## Key Principles
- Helps reduce bias, improve information processing, and minimize noise (aligned with the BIN model).
- Designed for LLM-assisted workflows — humans lead, models support.
- Forecasts are repeatable, transparent, and structured for review.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Forecast Title
Give your forecast a clear and specific name.

### 2. Initial Question Framing
- **Question:** Write or paste the full forecast question.
- **Clarifications:** Include dates, definitions, conditions, or known values.
- **Key Sources:** Cite relevant reports, articles, datasets, or studies.

### 3. Refinement & Analysis
- **Key Developments:** Summarize news, trends, or indicators.
- **Interpretation:** Explain how these developments shape your forecast.

*Tip: Use an LLM to generate analogies, test assumptions, or find outside views.*

### 4. Data Anomaly & Source Integrity Log
Record any irregularities in your data (e.g., outdated info, contradictions).  
If clean, write: “No anomalies noted.”

### 5. Probability Allocation
- First, clarify: is this a **binary** (Yes/No) or **multi-bucket** forecast?
- Then, assign probabilities that total 100%.
- Follow official bucket structures for platforms like GJO when applicable.

**Example (Multi-Bucket):**  
- 10% — Less than 2%  
- 40% — Between 2% and 3%  
- 30% — Between 3% and 4%  
- 20% — 4% or more

**Example (Binary):**  
- 70% — Yes  
- 30% — No

### 6. Final Forecast Summary
Summarize your forecast in 3–5 sentences. Include both outcome and reasoning.

### 7. Why Might You Be Wrong?
List 2–3 reasons your forecast could fail:
- Surprise events
- Bad assumptions
- Incomplete or low-integrity data

### 8. Inside-Outside View Comparison *(Optional – v3.1B Beta)*
Use both perspectives:
- **Inside View:** Context, intentions, micro-drivers
- **Outside View:** Base rates, historical outcomes

## Using MSCFT Without a Platform

- Use MSCFT as your own structured forecasting journal.
- Save entries in `.txt` or `.docx` format, and version them.
- Revisit past forecasts and compare outcomes for calibration.

## Closing Notes

- LLMs are support tools — always pair outputs with human judgment.
- MSCFT promotes disciplined thinking and long-term tracking.
- Suitable for public forecasting, private decision support, or academic research.
