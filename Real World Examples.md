## Real-World Alignment: AI-Human Org Chart Featuring MSCFT-Compatible Design
“The AI nodes and human interactions are just what the MSCFT does well.”
— Brian Helip, in response to a real-world implementation by Kathleen Perley

Faculty and AI advisor Kathleen Perley shared a powerful real-world deployment using OpenAI ChatGPT Agents to develop structured knowledge documentation for a fully integrated agent-based org chart. Her experience shows how AI agents can be embedded in operational workflows while maintaining human oversight — a design that strongly reflects MSCFT’s swarm-based coordination model.

This org chart closely mirrors MSCFT’s core structure:
- Human roles oversee mission-critical strategic decisions.
- AI agents are tasked with operational support (Finance, Support, Research).
- A hybrid structure allows for dynamic delegation and iterative refinement — consistent with MSCFT’s Node A–D framework.
