## Real-World Alignment: AI-Human Org Chart Featuring MSCFT-Compatible Design
‚ÄúThe AI nodes and human interactions are just what the MSCFT does well.‚Äù
‚Äî Brian Helip, in response to a real-world implementation by Kathleen Perley

Faculty and AI advisor Kathleen Perley shared a powerful real-world deployment using OpenAI ChatGPT Agents to develop structured knowledge documentation for a fully integrated agent-based org chart. Her experience shows how AI agents can be embedded in operational workflows while maintaining human oversight ‚Äî a design that strongly reflects MSCFT‚Äôs swarm-based coordination model.

This org chart closely mirrors MSCFT‚Äôs core structure:
- Human roles oversee mission-critical strategic decisions.
- AI agents are tasked with operational support (Finance, Support, Research).
- A hybrid structure allows for dynamic delegation and iterative refinement ‚Äî consistent with MSCFT‚Äôs Node A‚ÄìD framework.

This organizational chart was shared by Kathleen Perley (Faculty & AI Advisor at Rice University). It shows a real-world implementation of AI agents embedded alongside human executives in a functional structure. This aligns with MSCFT logic for swarm-based, multi-node agentic coordination.
