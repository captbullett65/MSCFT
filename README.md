# MSCFT

Master SWARM Consensus Forecasting Template â€” structured methodology for forecast framing, analysis, and audit.

# Master SWARM Consensus Forecasting Template (MSCFT)

The Master SWARM Consensus Forecasting Template (MSCFT) is a structured framework for developing, documenting, and auditing long-range, short-range forecasts across domains such as innovation, geopolitics, and public policy. This repository supports consistent forecasting practices for projects like the Good Judgment Open Vehicle Innovation Challenge (2025 & 2027), enabling transparent, high-quality judgment-based analysis.

## ðŸ“Œ Purpose

This project provides a standardized, auditable process for producing and maintaining high-integrity forecast logs. The MSCFT framework helps forecasters:
- Clearly frame and refine questions.
- Identify and document anomalies or source integrity concerns.
- Allocate probability using consistent buckets or binary formats.
- Introspect on potential sources of forecast error.
- Maintain internal validation logs and track performance over time.

## ðŸ§­ Structure

The core template includes **seven required sections** for each forecast:

1. Forecast Title  
2. Initial Question Framing  
3. Refinement & Analysis
4. Inside-Outside View Structuring
5. Data Anomaly & Source Integrity Log  
6. Probability Allocation  
7. Final Forecast Summary  
8. Why Might You Be Wrong? (two perspectives required)

All forecasts must follow this structure exactly.

## âœ… Forecasting Standards

- Use only **approved Good Judgement Open and RANGE  bucket phrasing**:
  - 2 or fewer  
  - Between 3 and 5  
  - Between 6 and 8  
  - Between 9 and 12  
  - Between 13 and 16  
  - Between 17 and 21  
  - 22 or more

- Ensure probability totals **add to exactly 100%**.
- Confirm if the question is **binary (Yes/No)** or **multi-range**.
- Include **rationale** and **error introspection** in all forecasts.

## ðŸ§  How to Contribute

See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for full instructions.

To summarize:
- Start with the MSCFT template in `/docs/`.
- Save completed logs in `/examples/`.
- Record audits or validations in `/logs/`.
- Update `forecast-index.md` with a working link to your file.

## ðŸ”’ Backups

Historical forecasts and index versions are stored in `/ backup-log.md/ ` as timestamped ZIPs.

MSCFT is maintained to ensure traceability, clarity, and reproducibility in judgment forecasting. Feedback and improvements are welcome via pull requests or issues.
