## Case Studies & Public Demonstrations

**Structured Prompting Prevents Harmful Output ‚Äì Grok + MSCFT Test**  
A real-world test of Grok 3 using the MSCFT 4.0A forecasting template demonstrated that the model produces accurate and safe outputs when given structured input.

# MSCFT

Master SWARM Consensus Forecasting Template ‚Äî structured methodology for forecast framing, analysis, and audit.

# Master SWARM Consensus Forecasting Template (MSCFT)

The Master SWARM Consensus Forecasting Template (MSCFT) is a structured framework for developing, documenting, and auditing long-range, short-range forecasts across domains such as innovation, geopolitics, and public policy. This repository supports consistent forecasting practices for projects like the Good Judgment Open Vehicle Innovation Challenge (2025 & 2027), enabling transparent, high-quality judgment-based analysis.

## How to Use the MSCFT

This section provides full instructions for using the MSCFT template with or without forecasting platforms.

### Key Use Cases

* Good Judgment Open, Range, RAND (RFI), Metaculus, and IARPA (crowdsourcing) projects
* Personal forecasting or journaling for learning
* Team-based scenario planning or risk analysis
* Academic use in economics, politics, policy, and technology domains

### Key Principles

* The MSCFT structure helps reduce bias, improve information processing, and limit noise ‚Äî consistent with the BIN model.
* It is ideal for LLM-assisted workflows: the forecaster leads, while the LLM helps generate, clarify, refine, and validate reasoning.
* You can use it independently or collaboratively ‚Äî forecasts are reproducible and ready for comparison.

### Background and Design Inspiration

MSCFT incorporates best practices drawn from applied forecasting, intelligence analysis, and structured analytic techniques. Notably, its framework and structure were influenced by the program/project management philosophies used in NASA‚Äôs [APPEL Knowledge Services](https://appel.nasa.gov/program-project-management/), where lifecycle discipline, auditability, and structured reasoning are foundational.

This makes MSCFT suitable for long-term forecasting initiatives, research, and collaborative problem solving ‚Äî not just one-off predictions.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### 1. Forecast Title

Give your forecast a specific, clear name.

#### 2. Initial Question Framing

* **Question:** Copy or write the question you‚Äôre answering.
* **Clarifications:** Add key dates, assumptions, definitions, or known values.
* **Key Sources:** List any data, news, reports, or research supporting your reasoning.

#### 3. Refinement & Analysis

* **Key Developments:** What‚Äôs happening that affects the forecast?
* **Interpretation:** Connect trends or scenarios to your reasoning.

*Tip: Use an LLM to generate analogies, test assumptions, or find outside views to strengthen your analysis.*

#### 4. Data Anomaly & Source Integrity Log

Note any irregularities in your data (e.g., outdated info, contradictions, or missing pieces). If clean, write ‚ÄúNo anomalies noted.‚Äù

#### 5. Probability Allocation

* Indicate whether the forecast is **binary** (Yes/No) or **multi-bucket** (ranges or categories).
* Use buckets that add to **100%**.
* Follow official platform formats when applicable (e.g., GJO), or define your own clearly.

**Example (Multi-Bucket):**

* 10% ‚Äî Less than 2%
* 40% ‚Äî Between 2% and 3%
* 30% ‚Äî Between 3% and 4%
* 20% ‚Äî 4% or more

**Example (Binary):**

* 70% ‚Äî Yes
* 30% ‚Äî No

BIN MODEL (Bias, Information, Noise)

Bias ‚Äì
Describe any systemic, institutional, cognitive, or structural biases that may influence the interpretation of the forecast question, its underlying data, or scenario framing. Address both source bias (e.g., media, academic, or policy bias) and forecaster bias (e.g., optimism/pessimism, threat inflation, anchoring on prior outcomes).

Information ‚Äì
Assess the quality, timeliness, resolution, and credibility of the information used. Clearly distinguish between confirmed data, predictive model output, outdated information, unverifiable claims, or speculation. Note any critical gaps or overreliance on a narrow set of sources.

Noise ‚Äì
Identify irrelevant, misleading, or low-signal data that may contaminate the forecasting logic. This includes information clutter, cherry-picked examples, emotionally charged narratives, or recency bias. Describe where noise may distort scenario weighting or probability distribution

#### 6. Final Forecast Summary

Write a short 3‚Äì5 sentence summary of your prediction and why you believe it‚Äôs likely.

#### 7. Why Might You Be Wrong?

List 2‚Äì3 possible failure points:

* Surprise events
* Bad assumptions
* Low-quality data

#### 8. Inside-Outside View Comparison *(Optional ‚Äì v3.1B Beta)*

* **Inside View:** Forecast based on context, intent, timing, or players.
* **Outside View:** Compare against base rates or historical analogs.

### Using MSCFT Without a Platform

If you're not posting to GJO or Metaculus:

* Treat this as your personal forecasting log.
* Save entries in `.txt` or `.docx` format with version numbers or timestamps.
* Track results over time and update forecasts as new data arrives.

### Final Notes

* MSCFT is LLM-friendly by design ‚Äî think of the model as a copilot, not a replacement for your reasoning.
* Keep your forecasts replicable, transparent, and structured for post-analysis.
* This methodology draws structural inspiration from NASA‚Äôs APPEL Knowledge Services, used in high-integrity program and project management.

## üìå Purpose

This project provides a standardized, auditable process for producing and maintaining high-integrity forecast logs. The MSCFT framework helps forecasters:
- Clearly frame and refine questions.
- Identify and document anomalies or source integrity concerns.
- Allocate probability using consistent buckets or binary formats.
- Introspect on potential sources of forecast error.
- Maintain internal validation logs and track performance over time.

## üß≠ Structure

The core template includes **Eight required sections** for each forecast:

1. Forecast Title  
2. Initial Question Framing  
3. Refinement & Analysis
4. Inside-Outside View Structuring
5. Data Anomaly & Source Integrity Log  
6. Probability Allocation  
7. Final Forecast Summary  
8. Why Might You Be Wrong? (two perspectives required)
