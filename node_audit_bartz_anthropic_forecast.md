# MSCFT Forecast Template Audit â€“ Bartz v. Anthropic PBC

This document verifies structural conformance of the MSCFT Template Version 4.2 to the Bartz v. Anthropic settlement forecast. Each node was reviewed for correct invocation, implicit usage, or justified omission.

## âœ… Nodes Used Correctly

### Node A â€” Research Node  
âœ” Explicitly invoked. The forecast included full question framing, resolution criteria, and structured source listing (Guardian, NPR, Court Listener, Yahoo News/Fortune).

### Node B â€” Analytical Node  
âœ” Fully invoked.
- **B.1:** Used correctly for binary question framing with structured Yes/No dual reasoning and stepwise evaluation.
- **B.2:** Applied BIN framework â€” Bias (media/legal framing), Information (docket & ruling), Noise (speculation/distortion).
- **B.3:** Provided primary point estimate (59%) with clear 90% confidence interval (45â€“70%) and rationale for width.

### Node C â€” Synthesis Node  
âœ” Applied. Final probability, rationale, and caveats were produced using MSCFT synthesis logic. Output contained:
- **C.2:** Final Forecast Summary
- **C.3:** Rationale for Distribution
- **C.4:** Error Pathways

### Node D â€” Interpretation Node  
âœ” Appropriately invoked.
- **D.1 (Entropy):** Shannon entropy calculation (0.973 bits) to assess outcome uncertainty.
- **D.3 (KL Divergence):** *Not invoked*, but not required â€” only one active forecast distribution was present. No comparative divergence needed.
- **D.2:** Symbolic logic not applicable â€” no recursive or formal logic mapping involved.

### Node E â€” Time Series Modeling  
âœ” Valid partial invocation:
- **E.2 (MA):** Used to model lagging impact from court rulings.
- **E.3 (ARIMA):** Time-series anchor using ruling + trial date inflection.
- **E.5 (ETS):** Applied to predict signal ramp-up as Q4 2025 nears.
- **E.7 (Spectral Entropy):** No anomalous volatility detected in legal action frequency.

### Node F â€” RAG Node  
âœ” Appropriately applied.
- **F.1â€“F.3:** Retrieval mapped to June 2025 decision and docket scope.
- **F.4:** Identified lag risks in public news vs. docket filings.
- **F.5:** Retrieval improved alignment on timing and resolution framing.
- **F.6:** Confirmed all sources human-reviewed and docket-based.

### Node G â€” Meta-Curation  
âœ” Confirmed.
- **G.1â€“G.3:** Input integrity validated using cross-source verification.
- **G.4â€“G.6:** No adversarial contamination or hallucinated sourcing detected. High signal-to-noise forecast.

## ðŸŸ¡ Optional or Justifiably Omitted Nodes

- **D.3 (KL Divergence):** Not applicable â€” only one distribution analyzed.
- **E.1, E.4, E.6:** AR, SARIMA, Fourier series not used due to lack of relevant cyclical or seasonal time behavior.
- **D.2 (Symbolic Logic):** Not invoked â€” no graph/tree structure required for this forecast.

## âœ… Structural Verdict: Template Compliant

All required nodes were either explicitly invoked or internally applied as per MSCFT v4.2 standards. No omissions or format violations. Entropy analysis, time-series modeling, retrieval validation, and BIN-layer reasoning were all structurally sound.

This file demonstrates how MSCFT forecasts can be audited node-by-node for compliance and can serve as a model for future swarm-based probability outputs.
