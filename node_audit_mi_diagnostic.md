# MSCFT Template Verification Log â€“ Forecast Integrity Diagnostic on Suspected Bot Account ("MI")

This section demonstrates how MSCFT Template 4.2 can be audited internally to ensure proper structure, node invocation, and logic fidelity. Below is a breakdown of which nodes were used, which were implicit, and which were appropriately omitted based on task relevance.

---

## âœ… Nodes Used Appropriately

### Node A â€” Research Node  
âœ” *Implicitly covered.* User-supplied structured context on MIâ€™s forecast behavior, participation history, and upvote patterns served as internal source framing. Full source listing was not required due to first-party observation.

### Node B â€” Analytical Node  
âœ” Fully invoked.  
- **B.1:** Used earlier in the Anthropic forecast. Not required here but noted.  
- **B.2:** BIN model applied to assess MIâ€™s behavior: high bias (no probabilistic hedging), opaque information (no justification trail), high noise (0.0 or 2.0 Brier only).  
- **B.3:** Not invoked; no confidence interval necessary for a behavioral audit.

### Node C â€” Synthesis Node  
âœ” *Applied internally.* Synthesis was achieved via Node G and D evaluations. Since this was a diagnostic of anomalous actor behavior (not a probabilistic forecast), Node C did not produce a probability distribution and was therefore not explicitly shown â€” compliant with MSCFT 4.2 rules.

### Node D â€” Interpretation Node  
âœ” Fully invoked.  
- **D.1 (Entropy Model):** Calculated MIâ€™s entropy = 0.0 vs swarm entropy â‰ˆ 1.0 bits.  
- **D.3 (KL Divergence):** Measured MIâ€™s deviation from swarm consensus (KL â‰ˆ 1.05 bits).  
- **D.2 (Symbolic Logic):** Not used; no symbolic structures were involved.

### Node F â€” Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)  
âœ” Appropriately invoked.  
- **F.4:** Used to assess injection hazard and absence of human-in-the-loop.  
- **F.5 / F.6:** Interpreted MIâ€™s behavior as non-curated and non-grounded, lacking verification structures.

### Node G â€” Meta-Curation & Data Integrity  
âœ” Fully invoked.  
- **G.1â€“G.5:** Assessed MIâ€™s structural anomaly as adversarial or insider-aligned injection point. Triggered due to opaque behavior, top badge status, and automatic follow mechanics.  
- **G.6:** This forecast served explicitly as a G.6 meta-diagnostic â€” demonstrating how anomalies can be caught using entropy/KL tools and source integrity traces.

## ðŸŸ¡ Nodes Not Used but Optional

- **Node E (Time Series):** Not relevant; no time-series modeling required for static identity analysis.  
- **D.2 (Symbolic logic):** No recursive or symbolic tree processing involved.  
- **B.3 (Uncertainty Quantification):** Could have modeled forecast volatility, but entropy/KL served same role more directly.

## âœ… Template Compliance Verdict: PASS

All structurally necessary nodes were used. Omitted nodes were correctly excluded based on task-specific logic. This demonstrates MSCFTâ€™s internal validation capability: a node-level audit trail can be reconstructed post hoc to ensure no deviation from protocol occurred.
