MSCFT Forecast Log – U.S.–Iran Escalation Scenario
Document generated on June 18, 2025 – 21:14 UTC
Forecast Title
Will the U.S. execute a B-2 stealth bomber strike using GBU-57 bunker-buster munitions against Iranian nuclear facilities before July 1, 2025?
Initial Question Framing (Copilot/GPT Input)
This forecast evaluates the likelihood that the U.S. will deploy B-2 bombers carrying GBU-57A/B Massive Ordnance Penetrators (MOPs) against Iranian nuclear targets—specifically hardened sites such as Fordow or Natanz—within the next two weeks. Signals include full B-2 positioning at Diego Garcia, Iranian rejection of a U.S. peace plan, a direct threat to the U.S. from Tehran, and the evacuation of American citizens from Israel. Four U.S. carrier strike groups are believed to be positioned for strategic containment.
Refinement & Analysis
- B-2s and B-52s confirmed at Diego Garcia
- Iran has rejected U.S. diplomatic efforts and threatened direct consequences if the U.S. intervenes
- Evacuations of American citizens from Israel are actively underway by air, land, and potentially U.S. naval assets
- Four U.S. carrier strike groups are present: one in the Mediterranean (European coverage) and three positioned around the Red Sea and Strait of Hormuz
- President Trump returned early from Canada and has said he 'may or may not strike,' maintaining strategic ambiguity
- Oil prices have surged from ~$60 to ~$75/barrel
- The British Prime Minister has placed his cabinet on alert for a possible U.S. strike
- The campaign will likely involve not only kinetic strikes but synchronized cyber attacks and drone-based sabotage operations to degrade Iranian infrastructure
- The Fordow facility may survive direct attack, so the U.S. goal may be operational paralysis, not total destruction
Data Anomaly & Source Integrity Log
- Diego Garcia confirmed as forward operating base for B-2 and B-52 bombers
- GBU-57 MOPs are only deployable by B-2s
- Statements from Iran's Supreme Leader confirm rejection of U.S. diplomacy and a threat of war if the U.S. intervenes
- Strategic deployment of four carrier strike groups verified via public defense monitoring
- Repeated public statements confirming U.S. evacuation operations underway
- Allied signals confirmed: UK cabinet placed on alert
- Economic markets signaling: Oil futures spike >20% in under 10 days
Probability Allocation (as of June 18, 2025)
Yes: 55% – No: 45%
Final Forecast Summary
The convergence of asset deployment, failed diplomacy, and strategic messaging indicates a high likelihood that a B-2 GBU-57 strike will occur before July 1, 2025. Civilian evacuations from Israel mark the final pre-kinetic phase, while carrier groups and stealth bombers signal launch-readiness. Even if Fordow is not completely destroyed, a combined kinetic-cyber-drone campaign may succeed in degrading Iran’s nuclear program and reasserting U.S. deterrence.
Why Might This Forecast Be Wrong?
- Trump could maintain ambiguity for political or diplomatic leverage
- Iran may backchannel concessions after public defiance
- U.S. partners or Congress might pressure against escalation
- B-2 deployment could serve as deterrence posture, not prelude to attack
Further Reasons Why This Forecast Might Be Incorrect
- Israel may act independently before U.S. coordinates
- Cyber or sabotage missions may obviate the need for kinetic action
- The Fordow strike may be deemed ineffective due to depth and fortification

[Update – June 18, 2025, 23:55 UTC]
The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) confirms that Israeli air operations since June 12 have significantly reduced Iran’s ability to retaliate with ballistic missile fire. ISW notes that Iran originally planned to launch approximately 1,000 missiles but has only managed around 200 due to damage inflicted on key missile infrastructure. Targets have included sites in Tehran, Kermanshah, and Esfahan, with assessments ongoing. Fordow remains a high-value target, and Israeli strikes have followed a systematic pattern aimed at degrading nuclear and launch capabilities. This supports the MSCFT forecast scenario of a coordinated air–cyber–drone campaign. ISW's confirmation of this campaign structure strengthens the reliability of the 55% probability allocation for a U.S. B-2 strike before July 1, 2025.
