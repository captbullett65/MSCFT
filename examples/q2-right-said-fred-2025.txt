# Master SWARM Consensus Forecasting Template (MSCFT)

## Forecast Title  
Average Price of a Dozen Large Eggs in the US – September 2025
 
**Forecaster:** Brian Helip

## Initial Question Framing  

**Question:**  
Clarifications:

Forecast refers to the national average retail price for a dozen large grade A eggs in the United States.

Data will be resolved using USDA monthly data or the BLS CPI subcomponent for eggs.

Price is usually reported in US dollars rounded to the nearest cent (e.g., $1.97).

Egg prices are volatile and heavily affected by avian flu outbreaks, feed costs, and seasonal consumer demand.

## Refinement & Analysis  

Key Developments:

As of April 2025, average US egg prices have stabilized after peaking above $4 in 2022 due to historic avian flu outbreaks.

USDA weekly data shows prices hovering between $1.60–$2.00 per dozen in Q2 2025, with some regional variance.

Feed costs (especially corn and soy) are down compared to 2022–2023, reducing upward pressure on egg prices.

No major avian flu outbreaks have been reported as of late May 2025, allowing production levels to normalize.

Consumer demand is seasonally soft in late summer but may rise toward fall holidays, depending on inflation trends.

Interpretation:
Absent a major supply shock, average retail egg prices in September 2025 are likely to remain in the $1.70–$2.10 range. Structural normalization is in progress, and production costs have eased. Historical patterns show that when there are no significant flu events, prices tend to revert toward long-term pre-pandemic averages (~$1.40–$2.00). However, this market is volatile and one outbreak or supply chain issue can shift prices rapidly.

## Data Anomaly & Source Integrity Log  

Date Range Affected:
January 2022 – March 2024 (historical volatility baseline)

Observed Anomaly:
Extraordinary volatility in egg prices due to highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) outbreaks caused spikes exceeding $4/dozen in 2022–2023.

Identified Cause:
Culling of tens of millions of laying hens during outbreaks sharply reduced supply. Additionally, pandemic-era supply chain issues increased transport and feed costs.

Implication for Forecast:
Recent price stability may be fragile. Another outbreak, even if regional, could sharply increase prices. Relying solely on 2024–2025 trends without factoring past event risks could result in underestimating volatility.

Action Taken:
Forecast adjusted to widen expected outcome range slightly and increase tail risk buckets to account for uncertainty in poultry health and biosecurity. Sources from USDA and industry reports are cross-referenced for outbreak monitoring.

## Probability Allocation  
ChatGPT said:
Excellent — you're using the official Good Judgment bucket format for egg prices. Let’s now rewrite the Probability Allocation section of your MSCFT file to match this structure exactly.

✅ STEP 4: Finalized Probability Allocation (Official Buckets)
Paste this into your Q2 forecast file under the Probability Allocation section:

Outcome:
Average US retail price for a dozen large eggs in September 2025.

Probability:
Buckets follow official Good Judgment formatting for price ranges in USD.

Rationale:
Given current supply stability, production costs, and the absence of major HPAI outbreaks, prices are likely to remain well below peak 2022–2023 levels. However, the structure of the egg market leaves room for sudden supply shocks. My base case centers around $2.20–$2.80, with a tapering distribution beyond $3.40.

Official Buckets:
Less than $2.200: 8%

At least $2.200, but less than $2.800: 35%

At least $2.800, but less than $3.400: 25%

At least $3.400, but less than $4.000: 15%

At least $4.000, but less than $4.600: 8%

At least $4.600, but less than $5.200: 5%

At least $5.200, but less than $5.800: 2%

At least $5.800, but less than $6.400: 1%

At least $6.400, but less than $7.000: 0.5%

$7.000 or more: 0.5%

Total: 100%

## Final Forecast Summary  
ChatGPT said:

Forecast:
The most likely outcome is that the average retail price for a dozen large eggs in September 2025 will fall between $2.20 and $2.80, with a central estimate near $2.45.

Explanation:
After record volatility in 2022–2023 driven by avian flu and feed costs, egg prices have returned to seasonal norms. Recent USDA and BLS data show stable pricing with moderate input costs and no new outbreaks. While the egg market is sensitive to supply shocks, current production trends suggest that barring a health crisis, prices will remain between $2.20 and $2.80. Higher outcomes are still possible but would require significant disruption.
