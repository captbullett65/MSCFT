## Forecast Title  
Ethereum (ETH) Price — 30 September 2025

**Forecaster:** Brian Helip

## Initial Question Framing  

**Question:**  
What will be the price of one Ethereum (ETH) token on 30 September 2025?

**Clarifications:**  
- Forecast is for the USD price of Ethereum as recorded on Coinbase and reported by the FRED database.  
- The question will be suspended on 30 September 2025 and resolved using the closing price recorded in the FRED data feed.  
- Historical reference: Ethereum was priced at $2,447.55 on 30 September 2024.

**Key Sources:**  
- FRED: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CBCLOSE  
- Coinbase ETH/USD feed

## Refinement & Analysis  

**Key Developments:**  
- Ethereum rebounded from a 52-week low triggered by the U.S. announcing trade policy shifts in 2024.  
- ETH has since recovered above $2,400, reflecting renewed investor confidence and macro stabilization.  
- Institutional adoption, ETF speculation, and smart contract upgrades (e.g., Dencun fork) have supported bullish momentum.  
- Risk-off trends in equities and rate cuts expected in 2025 could further increase ETH demand as a speculative hedge.  
- Regulatory clarity around ETH as a commodity rather than security may influence market volatility.

**Interpretation:**  
While Ethereum remains volatile, its ability to rebound after macro and policy shocks suggests support above $2,100 barring a major crypto selloff. Upside potential exists if ETF-related flows increase or institutional adoption accelerates. However, crypto sentiment is sensitive to regulation, and high beta behavior means tail risk remains high. Central case targets $2,400–$3,000.

## Data Anomaly & Source Integrity Log  

**Date Range Affected:**  
June 2022 – January 2023

**Observed Anomaly:**  
ETH price collapsed over 60% in 2022 due to FTX collapse, macro tightening, and DeFi liquidity issues.

**Identified Cause:**  
Systemic trust erosion in crypto markets and high correlation with Fed tightening cycle.

**Implication for Forecast:**  
Historic volatility remains extreme relative to equities or FX. Base rate comparisons must account for non-linear rebounds and speculative surges.

**Action Taken:**  
Forecasts adjusted to account for both past crash risk and recent resiliency. Relying on FRED/CB price data ensures consistent resolution.

## Probability Allocation  

**Outcome:**  
ETH/USD price on Coinbase as recorded in FRED on 30 September 2025

**Probability:**  
Forecast uses official GJO bucket ranges.

**Rationale:**  
Price is likely to remain above $2,100 if macro conditions hold steady and no major regulatory or security shocks occur. Bullish continuation possible if ETF interest grows, though >$3,600 would require a significant market-wide surge.

- Less than $1,200: 2%  
- At least $1,200, but less than $1,500: 3%  
- At least $1,500, but less than $1,800: 5%

- At least $3,000, but less than $3,300: 12%  
- At least $3,300, but less than $3,600: 7%  
- At least $3,600, but less than $3,900: 5%  
- At least $3,900, but less than $4,200: 3%  
- At least $4,200, but less than $4,500: 2%

## Final Forecast Summary  

**Forecast:**  
Most likely ETH price on 30 September 2025 is between **$2,400 and $3,000**, with a median estimate of approximately **$2,750**.

**Explanation:**  
Following a rebound from late-2024 lows, Ethereum has regained market structure and investor confidence. Regulatory pressure remains a risk, but tailwinds from institutional participation and macro easing may support the mid-$2K range. Higher outcomes require broad crypto bullishness or a new catalyst (e.g., ETH ETF approval or major DeFi growth).

## Why Might This Forecast Be Wrong?

### Inside View (Scenario/Assumption Bias)  
- I may be underestimating systemic risks in DeFi or exchanges that could cause another market-wide drawdown.  
- My baseline may be anchored too closely to current trends without fully accounting for macro volatility.  
- Overestimating institutional demand in the absence of clear legal/regulatory support could result in overconfidence.

### Outside View (Base Rate / Historical Anomaly Risk)  
- Ethereum's past includes multiple >40% drawdowns in short timeframes — base rates suggest high unpredictability.  
- Policy shocks (e.g., crypto taxation, SEC actions) have triggered unexpected market moves in the past.  
- ETH performance often correlates with BTC and tech equities; external downturns could cascade into crypto despite strong ETH fundamentals.
