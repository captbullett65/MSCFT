# Master SWARM Consensus Forecasting Template (MSCFT)

## Forecast Title  
US CPI – 12-Month Change for September 2025  

**Forecaster:** Brian Helip
---
## Initial Question Framing  

**Question:**  
What will be the 12-month percentage change in the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) for September 2025?

**Clarifications:**  
- Forecast is for year-over-year change from September 2024 to September 2025.  
- Forecast will be resolved using final U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics CPI release for September 2025.  
- BLS defines CPI as a measure of the average change in prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services.

**Key Sources:**  
- https://www.bls.gov/cpi/  
- Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)  
- Inflation expectations data (e.g., University of Michigan, NY Fed)

Key Developments:

Headline CPI as of April 2025 was at [insert latest YoY %], continuing a trend of gradual disinflation since mid-2023.

Core CPI (excluding food and energy) has remained more persistent but is also showing signs of deceleration.

Fed policy remains in a holding pattern with rate cuts increasingly priced in for late 2025, depending on inflation momentum.

Supply chain normalization and a strong dollar have helped cap import inflation, though housing and services inflation remain sticky.

Labor market indicators show slowing job growth, but wage inflation is still above 3.5%.

Interpretation:
The forecast for September 2025 CPI will depend heavily on oil prices, shelter costs, and wage pass-through. If energy prices stay stable and wage growth continues cooling, a YoY CPI reading between 2.8% and 3.3% is plausible. Upside risks include a resurgence in housing inflation or unexpected geopolitical shocks affecting energy. Downside risk exists if consumer demand softens more than expected due to credit tightening or labor weakness. I'm currently leaning toward a mid-range CPI value consistent with a Fed pause environment.]

Date Range Affected:
February 2024 – April 2025

Observed Anomaly:
Lag in real-time shelter cost adjustments; BLS data tends to smooth rental inflation even when market rates fall quickly.

Identified Cause:
BLS methodology for Owners’ Equivalent Rent (OER) and primary rent introduces significant lags due to survey collection intervals and averaging.

Implication for Forecast:
CPI may continue to show elevated housing inflation through Q3 2025 even if real-world rents are declining. This may skew overall CPI higher than macro conditions suggest.

Action Taken:
Forecast adjusted to allow for persistent housing inflation even in the presence of weakening consumer demand. Energy and core goods components assumed to contribute mild disinflation.

## Probability Allocation 

Outcome:
Year-over-year percentage change in US Consumer Price Index (CPI) for September 2025.

Probability:
Forecast uses the official Good Judgment bucket format for CPI percentage change.

Rationale:
April 2025 CPI YoY was 3.4%. Disinflation trends continue, but shelter and services remain sticky. My base case is centered around 2.8%–3.2%, with upside tail risk if shelter inflation fails to moderate or oil spikes. Downside risk includes weakening demand or labor market cooling faster than expected.

Official Bucketed Forecast:
Up by less than 1.600% or down: 5%

Up by at least 1.600%, but less than 2.000%: 8%

Up by at least 2.000%, but less than 2.400%: 12%

Up by at least 2.400%, but less than 2.800%: 20%

Up by at least 2.800%, but less than 3.200%: 25%

Up by at least 3.200%, but less than 3.600%: 15%

Up by at least 3.600%, but less than 4.000%: 8%

Up by at least 4.000%, but less than 4.400%: 5%

Up by 4.400% or more: 2%

Total: 100%

## Final Forecast Summary  
Forecast:
The most likely outcome is that the September 2025 US CPI year-over-year change will fall between 2.8% and 3.2%, with a central estimate around 2.95%.

Explanation:
Disinflation has taken hold in headline CPI, aided by stabilizing energy prices and easing goods prices. However, services inflation, especially shelter, remains sticky due to methodological lags and tight housing markets in key regions. The Federal Reserve has signaled a pause, with rate cuts likely only if inflation sustainably approaches 2%. Current data suggests moderation without collapse, supporting a mid-2% CPI outcome barring external shocks.

## Why Might This Forecast Be Wrong?

Inside View (Scenario/Assumption Bias)

I may be underestimating the persistence of services inflation, especially if wage growth reaccelerates due to labor shortages.

My assumptions about the shelter component cooling may be premature given how lagged BLS housing data is.

I may be over-relying on soft-landing scenarios, discounting potential policy missteps or external shocks.

There’s a possibility I’m anchoring too closely to recent CPI trends and under-weighting volatility.

Outside View (Base Rate / Historical Anomaly Risk)
Historically, CPI disinflation from 3.5%+ to the 2% range often takes longer than a year, especially if core components are sticky.

Base rate comparisons to similar cycles (e.g., 1990s, post-GFC) suggest a slower glide path than my mid-2025 expectation.

Inflation surprises in the past (e.g., early 2021) have occurred despite broad expectations of moderation.

Geopolitical events, commodity shocks, or supply disruptions could materially alter the outlook outside base rate logic.
