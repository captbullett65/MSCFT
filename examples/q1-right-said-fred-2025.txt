# Master SWARM Consensus Forecasting Template (MSCFT)

## Forecast Title  
US CPI – 12-Month Change for September 2025  

**Forecaster:** Brian Helip

## Initial Question Framing  

**Question:**  
What will be the 12-month percentage change in the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) for September 2025?

**Clarifications:**  
- Forecast is for year-over-year change from September 2024 to September 2025.  
- Forecast will be resolved using final U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics CPI release for September 2025.  
- BLS defines CPI as a measure of the average change in prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services.

**Key Sources:**  
- https://www.bls.gov/cpi/  
- Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)  
- Inflation expectations data (e.g., University of Michigan, NY Fed)

Key Developments:

Headline CPI as of April 2025 was at [insert latest YoY %], continuing a trend of gradual disinflation since mid-2023.

Core CPI (excluding food and energy) has remained more persistent but is also showing signs of deceleration.

Fed policy remains in a holding pattern with rate cuts increasingly priced in for late 2025, depending on inflation momentum.

Supply chain normalization and a strong dollar have helped cap import inflation, though housing and services inflation remain sticky.

Labor market indicators show slowing job growth, but wage inflation is still above 3.5%.

Interpretation:
The forecast for September 2025 CPI will depend heavily on oil prices, shelter costs, and wage pass-through. If energy prices stay stable and wage growth continues cooling, a YoY CPI reading between 2.8% and 3.3% is plausible. Upside risks include a resurgence in housing inflation or unexpected geopolitical shocks affecting energy. Downside risk exists if consumer demand softens more than expected due to credit tightening or labor weakness. I'm currently leaning toward a mid-range CPI value consistent with a Fed pause environment.]

Date Range Affected:
February 2024 – April 2025

Observed Anomaly:
Lag in real-time shelter cost adjustments; BLS data tends to smooth rental inflation even when market rates fall quickly.

Identified Cause:
BLS methodology for Owners’ Equivalent Rent (OER) and primary rent introduces significant lags due to survey collection intervals and averaging.

Implication for Forecast:
CPI may continue to show elevated housing inflation through Q3 2025 even if real-world rents are declining. This may skew overall CPI higher than macro conditions suggest.

Action Taken:
Forecast adjusted to allow for persistent housing inflation even in the presence of weakening consumer demand. Energy and core goods components assumed to contribute mild disinflation.
