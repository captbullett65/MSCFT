## Forecast Title

**Forecaster:** Brian Helip

## Initial Question Framing  

**Question:**  
What will be the average price for a gallon of regular conventional gasoline in the United States on Monday, 29 September 2025?

**Clarifications:**  
- Forecast refers to the U.S. national average price for regular conventional gasoline as reported by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).  
- The outcome will be determined using the FRED database (St. Louis Federal Reserve).  
- Historical baseline: $3.087 on 30 September 2024.

**Key Sources:**

- OPEC+ announcements and SPR data (CNBC, Bloomberg, Yahoo)

## Refinement & Analysis  

**Key Developments:**  
- OPEC+ has announced production increases for the second half of 2025, pressuring oil futures downward.  
- Despite military tensions involving Iran, markets have not priced in significant disruption to supply chains.  
- Seasonally, US gasoline prices tend to decline after summer driving season ends.  
- US refining capacity remains healthy, and no major hurricane disruptions are expected.  
- The price was $3.087 on 30 September 2024.

**Interpretation:**  
Market signals suggest moderate disinflation in gasoline pricing unless a supply-side event (e.g., Middle East escalation or refinery outage) occurs. With oil markets stabilizing and travel tapering, prices are likely to settle between $2.75 and $3.25 per gallon. Upside risk remains tied to geopolitics; downside potential is tied to weak demand and high inventories.

## Data Anomaly & Source Integrity Log  

**Date Range Affected:**  
February 2022 – October 2023

**Observed Anomaly:**  
Extreme price fluctuations tied to Russia-Ukraine war and strategic reserve releases distorted typical seasonal patterns.

**Identified Cause:**  
Supply shocks, rapid SPR deployment, and pandemic recovery effects distorted year-over-year comparisons.

**Implication for Forecast:**  
Historical base rates pre-2022 may not fully apply. Comparisons to 2022–2023 require adjustments for non-recurring shocks.

**Action Taken:**  
Anchoring to 2024–2025 EIA and FRED trendline data. Geopolitical variables monitored for live updates.

## Probability Allocation  

**Outcome:**  
Average US gasoline price per gallon on 29 September 2025

**Probability:**  
Forecast uses official Good Judgment price buckets

**Rationale:**  
Base case rests on OPEC+ production boost, easing demand, and no catastrophic supply shocks. Moderate downside is expected barring a major event.

## Final Forecast Summary  

**Forecast:**  
Most likely average price is between **$2.75 and $3.00**, centered around **$2.88** per gallon.

**Explanation:**  
Seasonal factors, stable refining capacity, and OPEC+ production increases suggest a controlled pricing environment. Without new geopolitical disruptions, prices should track slightly lower than the 2024 level of $3.087. Base case is disinflation with mild upside tail risk.

## Why Might This Forecast Be Wrong?

### Inside View (Scenario/Assumption Bias)  
- I may be underweighting geopolitical escalation risk tied to Iran or shipping routes.  
- Seasonal effects may be less reliable if refinery maintenance or hurricane season extends later.  
- I’m assuming demand softens in Q3, but EV adoption or commuter patterns could shift unexpectedly.

### Outside View (Base Rate / Historical Anomaly Risk)  
- Gasoline prices frequently spike above expectations due to refinery outages, not just crude price shocks.  
- In previous years, even modest Gulf Coast storms caused large regional and national shifts.  
- Historical price moderation after summer travel may be less predictable post-2020 due to energy market reshuffling.
