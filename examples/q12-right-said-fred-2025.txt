## Forecast Title  
US Yield Curve Spread — 10-Year Minus 2-Year Treasury Rate (as of 30 September 2025)

**Forecaster:** Brian Helip

## Initial Question Framing  

**Question:**  
What will be the spread between the US 10-year Treasury yield and the 2-year Treasury yield on 30 September 2025?

**Clarifications:**  
- Spread = 10-year yield minus 2-year yield.  
- Outcome determined using FRED series "T10Y2Y" (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/T10Y2Y).  
- Spread on 30 September 2024 was 0.15%.  
- The question will be suspended on 29 September 2025.

## Refinement & Analysis  

**Key Developments:**  
- As of mid-2025, the curve has steepened slightly from its deepest inversion in early 2023.  
- Market expectations indicate a pivot in Fed policy by late 2025, lifting 2-year yields slightly less than 10-year yields.  
- Treasury issuance and deficit fears have nudged long rates upward.  
- Historical precedent shows curve normalization typically occurs 6–12 months before or after recessionary conditions.  
- Soft landing expectations dominate, with inflation stable and moderate growth anticipated.

**Interpretation:**  
While inversion has begun to unwind, full normalization is uncertain. Fed may reduce short-term rates, but long-end inflation expectations and fiscal supply pressures will determine the spread. A modest positive spread (0.25%–0.75%) is the most probable, though downside risk exists if the Fed delays cuts.

## Data Anomaly & Source Integrity Log  

**Date Range Affected:**  
2022–2024

**Observed Anomaly:**  
Historic yield curve inversion (-1.0%) lasting over a year.

**Identified Cause:**  
Aggressive Fed tightening during a softening economic cycle, paired with delayed long-term yield response.

**Implication for Forecast:**  
High-duration inversions are rare, and normalization often occurs rapidly. Cannot assume gradual unwinding without macro triggers.

**Action Taken:**  
Used post-2000 normalization events as base rate guide; cross-checked yield spreads with forward curve pricing.

## Probability Allocation  

**Outcome:**  
10y–2y Treasury yield spread on 30 September 2025

**Probability:**  
Structured per GJO buckets.

**Rationale:**  
Steepening is likely but not guaranteed. A neutral-to-positive curve is plausible as the Fed shifts to an easing stance. Long-end supply effects and foreign demand will be key.

- -0.25% or lower: 3%  
- Higher than -0.25%, but at most 0.00%: 10%  
- Higher than 0.00%, but at most 0.25%: 20%  
- Higher than 0.25%, but at most 0.50%: 25%  
- Higher than 0.50%, but at most 0.75%: 20%  
- Higher than 0.75%, but at most 1.00%: 12%  
- Higher than 1.00%, but at most 1.25%: 6%  
- Higher than 1.25%, but at most 1.50%: 3%  
- Higher than 1.50%: 1%

**Total: 100%**

## Final Forecast Summary  

**Forecast:**  
The 10-year minus 2-year Treasury yield spread will likely be between **0.25% and 0.75%**, with a median estimate near **0.40%**.

**Explanation:**  
Fed normalization, modest growth expectations, and long-term inflation anchoring will push the curve positive. However, lingering inversion effects and policy uncertainty limit confidence in extreme steepening.

## Why Might This Forecast Be Wrong?

### Inside View (Scenario/Assumption Bias)  
- I may be overconfident in curve normalization; the Fed may hold higher for longer.  
- Underweighting the risk of new shocks (e.g., oil, geopolitical) disrupting long rates.  
- Assumes too clean a progression toward soft landing; abru
