**Question:**  
What will be the weekly average interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages in the United States for the week ending 25 September 2025?

**Clarifications:**

## Refinement & Analysis  

**Key Developments:**  
- Trump administration’s push to privatize Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac has caused concern in mortgage markets (Reuters).  
- Treasury yields have remained elevated, placing upward pressure on mortgage rates.  
- The Fed has signaled rate stabilization or modest cuts, but spreads remain wide.  
- Mortgage applications are near multi-decade lows, and housing affordability has deteriorated.  
- Homebuilder sentiment has softened, though new starts remain stable.

**Interpretation:**  
Mortgage rates are expected to remain sticky near current levels. Even with easing Fed guidance, risk premiums tied to agency uncertainty and bond market volatility may keep 30-year fixed rates in the 6.10%–7.30% range. Political risk adds an upward skew, though a sudden Treasury rally could compress yields and lead to a rate dip.

## Data Anomaly & Source Integrity Log  

**Date Range Affected:**  
March 2022 – October 2023

**Observed Anomaly:**  
Rapid increases in 30-year mortgage rates, jumping from ~3% to over 7% within a 12-month period.

**Identified Cause:**  
Aggressive Fed rate hikes in response to inflation; normalization shocks in MBS spreads.

**Implication for Forecast:**  
This precedent anchors volatility expectations. While not expected to repeat, it suggests tail risks are structurally possible even in stable macro periods.

**Action Taken:**  
Maintained vigilance for spread behavior and policy-linked volatility. Anchored forecast to observable Fed and Treasury dynamics, with overlay of conservatorship policy path.
