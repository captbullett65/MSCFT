## 🔍 Extracted Reasoning from Thread

### 1. **Stated Position**  
> “I’m not saying she’s innocent or guilty — but I’ve heard enough to have serious doubts about the prosecution’s story.”

### 2. **Weather & Acceleration Doubt**  
> “It was snowing and icy that night. The prosecution says she hit him with her car at a certain speed — but in those conditions, it’s hard to believe the car could have accelerated fast enough.”

### 3. **Contradictory Eyewitness (Snowplow Driver)**  
> “A snowplow driver said he passed the house and didn’t see anyone in the yard or snowbank… If a body was already there, you’d expect it to be visible in fresh snow.”
