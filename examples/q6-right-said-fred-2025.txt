## Forecast Title  
U.S. U-6 Unemployment Rate — September 2025

**Forecaster:** Brian Helip

## Initial Question Framing  

**Question:**  
What will be the U.S. U-6 unemployment rate for September 2025?

**Clarifications:**  
- Forecast refers to the official BLS U-6 rate, as first released and reported in the FRED database.  
- U-6 is the broadest measure of unemployment, including discouraged workers and part-time employees for economic reasons.  
- Question will be suspended on 30 September 2025 and resolved once the September data is first published by BLS.  
- September 2024 U-6 unemployment rate was 7.7%.

## Refinement & Analysis  

**Key Developments:**  
- As of mid-2025, labor markets remain resilient despite slowing job openings and cooling wage growth.  
- U-3 (headline unemployment) remains stable around 4.1%, while U-6 trends around 7.4% to 7.8%.  
- Federal Reserve policy has shifted toward a pause, with slight loosening expected if inflation continues to fall.  
- Major tech and logistics firms have announced targeted layoffs, though service sector hiring remains robust.  
- Labor force participation rate has remained flat, with modest recovery in discouraged worker engagement.

**Interpretation:**  
The September 2025 U-6 rate is likely to stay close to its current range (7.4–7.8%), barring a significant economic downturn. Leading indicators (job openings, wage growth, hours worked) suggest plateauing, not collapse. Upside risks come from delayed effects of past tightening; downside risks exist if demand outperforms or labor force re-entry remains strong.

## Data Anomaly & Source Integrity Log  

**Date Range Affected:**  
March 2020 – April 2022

**Observed Anomaly:**  
Pandemic-related distortions in U-6 due to temporary shutdowns, misclassification of unemployed as “employed but absent.”

**Identified Cause:**  
COVID-19 disruptions and data collection inconsistencies.

**Implication for Forecast:**  
Pre-2023 base rates can be skewed upward; recent trends are more stable. Structural long-term unemployment may still distort interpretation.

**Action Taken:**  
Focused analysis on post-2023 normalization period. FRED/BLS first release values used exclusively for resolution.

## Probability Allocation  

**Outcome:**  
BLS-reported U-6 unemployment rate for September 2025, as first published and recorded by FRED.

**Probability:**  
Forecast uses official GJO bucket ranges.

**Rationale:**  
My central case projects that U-6 will stay within its recent band (7.0%–7.8%), with moderate downside potential if labor force engagement improves, and moderate upside risk if private-sector job growth stalls unexpectedly.

- Less than 6.6%: 2%  
- At least 6.6%, but less than 7.0%: 10%  
- At least 7.0%, but less than 7.4%: 25%  
- At least 7.4%, but less than 7.8%: 30%  
- At least 7.8%, but less than 8.2%: 15%  
- At least 8.2%, but less than 8.6%: 8%  
- At least 8.6%, but less than 9.0%: 5%  
- At least 9.0%, but less than 9.4%: 3%  
- At least 9.4%, but less than 9.8%: 1%  
- 9.8% or more: 1%

**Total: 100%**

## Final Forecast Summary  

**Forecast:**  
Most likely outcome is a U-6 rate between **7.4% and 7.8%**, with a central estimate of **7.6%**.

**Explanation:**  
Indicators suggest continued labor market strength despite normalization in hiring and job turnover. Unless there is a downturn or widespread layoffs, the U-6 rate is likely to stay within a stable band just below 8%. Marginal improvements in part-time employment and discouraged worker participation may nudge the rate lower, but not drastically.

## Why Might This Forecast Be Wrong?

### Inside View (Scenario/Assumption Bias)  
- I may be overestimating labor market resilience and underweighting delayed effects of tighter credit or corporate cost-cutting.  
- Assumes stable labor force participation, which could shift significantly due to policy changes, automation, or immigration dynamics.  
- Anchoring to recent ranges may obscure warning signs in underemployment or hidden unemployment metrics.

### Outside View (Base Rate / Historical Anomaly Risk)  
- Post-pandemic volatility makes it hard to draw clean comparisons; structural labor shifts may create new “norms.”  
- In past cycles, U-6 has spiked quickly when recessionary pressures build — often faster than headline unemployment.  
- External shocks (e.g., geopolitical, climate-related, or energy spikes) could weaken hiring faster than modeled.
