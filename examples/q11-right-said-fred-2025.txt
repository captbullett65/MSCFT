## Initial Question Framing  

**Question:**  
What will be the yield for US 10-year Treasury securities on 30 September 2025?

**Clarifications:**

- The yield on 30 September 2024 was 3.81%.  
- The question will be suspended on 29 September 2025.

## Refinement & Analysis  

**Key Developments:**  
- As of mid-2025, yields have been volatile due to Fed uncertainty and geopolitical risk.  
- The Fed has paused hikes but maintains a hawkish posture, delaying cuts.  
- Term premium remains elevated amid fiscal concerns and global debt selloffs.  
- Market pricing suggests a 20–30 bps upward skew, but recession risks cap long-end pressure.  
- Recent CPI prints have been slightly above expectations.

**Interpretation:**  
Yields are likely to stay within the 3.90%–4.80% range. Slight upward pressure exists from deficit dynamics and Fed balance sheet runoff. However, long-term inflation expectations remain anchored, and global capital flows into Treasuries could cap the top end. The mid-4% range looks most likely unless there's a surprise economic acceleration or shock.

## Data Anomaly & Source Integrity Log  

**Date Range Affected:**  
2022–2023

**Observed Anomaly:**  
Rapid spike in 10-year yields from ~1.5% to over 4.0% due to Fed tightening.

**Identified Cause:**  
Inflation panic, supply-demand imbalance, and shifting expectations about Fed neutrality.

**Implication for Forecast:**  
Reinforces caution in assigning high probability to extreme yield compression or spikes without strong macro justification.

**Action Taken:**  
Anchored forecast on Q2–Q3 2025 macro data, focused on stable inflation and neutral Fed rate policy.

## Probability Allocation  

**Outcome:**  
10-year US Treasury yield on 30 September 2025

**Probability:**  
Official GJO bucket formatting.

**Rationale:**  
Baseline assumes modest upward drift from current levels, constrained by real yield compression and safe haven demand. Topside capped without reacceleration in growth/inflation.

- Less than 3.30%: 2%  
- At least 3.30%, but less than 3.60%: 5%  
- At least 3.60%, but less than 3.90%: 14%  
- At least 3.90%, but less than 4.20%: 22%  
- At least 4.20%, but less than 4.50%: 20%  
- At least 4.50%, but less than 4.80%: 15%  
- At least 4.80%, but less than 5.10%: 10%  
- At least 5.10%, but less than 5.40%: 5%  
- At least 5.40%, but less than 5.70%: 3%  
- At least 5.70%, but less than 6.00%: 2%  
- 6.00% or more: 2%

**Total: 100%**

## Final Forecast Summary  

**Forecast:**  
The US 10-year Treasury yield will most likely fall between **3.90% and 4.50%**, with a median estimate of **4.2%**.

**Explanation:**  
Stable macro conditions and balanced investor sentiment are driving range-bound yield behavior. Slight upward pressure from debt issuance and Fed balance sheet policy is counterbalanced by global demand for safe assets and moderating inflation.

## Why Might This Forecast Be Wrong?

### Inside View (Scenario/Assumption Bias)  
- I may be underestimating the potential for rapid Fed cuts, especially if recessionary signals emerge.  
- I may be overweighting the impact of Treasury issuance and underweighting capital inflows.

### Outside View (Base Rate / Historical Anomaly Risk)  
- In past years, 10-year yields have moved 100 bps in less than 90 days.  
- Unexpected global financial events or rate cuts abroad can cause sudden yield compression in Treasuries.
